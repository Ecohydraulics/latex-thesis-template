Describe logical links that can be inferred from your results here. How do the results help to test the hypotheses stated in \autoref{sec:rq}?\vspace{1em}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Do not} write: "The hypothesis is True" or "The hypothesis is False".
	\item \textbf{Do} write: "No evidence was found that the hypothesis is false." or "Evidence was found that the hypothesis is false."
\end{itemize}
\vspace{1em}
Now, how does this help answering the research question; what remains uncertain; what are weaknesses in the methods? (This should be discussed here.)

\infobox{Why so complicated?}{
	From a scientific perspective, we can never be absolutely sure about the truth of a hypothesis. This is why we need to use this complicated writing.
