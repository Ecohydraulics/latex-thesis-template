Describe logical links that can be inferred from your results here. How do the results help to test the hypotheses stated in \autoref{sec:rq}?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Do not write: "The hypothesis is True" or "The hypothesis is False".
	\item Do write: "No evidence was found that the hypothesis is false." or "Evidence was found that the hypothesis is false."
\end{itemize}


\infobox{Why so complicated?}{
	From a scientific perspective, we can never be absolutely sure about the truth of a hypothesis. This is why we need to use this complicated writing.
}

Now, how does this help answering the research question?
