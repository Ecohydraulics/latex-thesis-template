  abstract = {Requirements for measures of uncertainty and uncertainty-based information are introduced and discussed in generic terms. Generalizations of the Hartley measure of nonspecificity to the theory of graded possibilities and Dempster-Shafer theory are examined in detail, including the respective uniqueness proofs. A historical overview is presented of several unsuccessful attempts to generalize the Shannon entropy. An aggregated measure of uncertainty, which satisfies all the essential requirements, is introduced. It is shown that this measure is applicable to all uncertainty theories, but it is not sufficiently sensitive. Two ways of disaggregating this measure are introduced and compared.},

PEST, a model-independent parameter estimation tool, is one such tool used extensively in groundwater model calibration. PEST was linked to the eWater CRC Source Catchments water quantity and quality model to calibrate the parameter values for component SIMHYD rainfall runoff and Laurenson non-linear flow routing models. The calibration process was applied across 450,000 km2 in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Queensland. Six models were built, with catchments ranging in area from 10,000 {\textendash} 156,000 km2. A consistent approach to model calibration was applied across all models. Unique SIMHYD parameter sets were generated for the three dominant Hydrologic Response Units (HRU): forest, grazing and agriculture.},

The objectives of this article are to: (1) provide guidelines to properly document H/WQ model calibration, validation, and use, and (2) raise issues about how to improve model documentation and reproducibility, and encourage open discussion of these topics in the H/WQ modeling community. First, eight recommended elements of model documentation and reporting are identified and described, and good examples are provided for each. Next, steps to move the H/WQ modeling community toward a culture of full model reproducibility are discussed. The use by model practitioners of the consistent and comprehensive elements described herein for documentation and reporting of H/WQ model calibration, validation, and use will allow better interpretation of published modeling studies, improve the utility of modeling studies, and allow more systematic advancement of H/WQ models.},

This article introduces a special collection of nine research articles covering key topics related to calibration and validation of H/WQ models. The topics include: terminology, hydrologic processes and model representation, spatial and temporal scales, model parameterization, C/V strategies, sensitivity, uncertainty, performance measures and criteria, and documentation and reporting. The main objective of this introductory article is to introduce and summarize key aspects of these topics, including recommendations. Individually, the articles provide model practitioners with detailed topic-specific recommendations related to model calibration, validation, and use. Collectively, the articles present recommendations to enhance H/WQ modeling.},

  abstract = {Most alluvial rivers have a tendency to meander as they flow downslope. This process of planform evolution is controlled by several components such as flow conditions, sediment, vegetation, and geological characteristics of the channel boundaries. The interactions of these components result in a complex system, which can not be completely described yet, even with the advance of computational, experimental and field resources. Several laboratory-based studies have dealt with periodic symmetric channel configurations and have described the importance of high-amplitude and high-curvature bends in terms of flow structure and sediment redistribution. However, most rivers present not only symmetric, but also asymmetric planform configurations. This study attempts to provide some insight into the hydrodynamic description of the flow in laboratory-scaled asymmetric meandering channels (Kinoshita-generated). Sediment transport and morphological evolution are not considered in this first stage of the study; thus, the meandering channels have been described topographically by using an empirical formulation based on local curvature and channel forming discharge. Four river stages (angular sinuosity:{\texttheta} = 20{\textdegree},50{\textdegree},90{\textdegree},100{\textdegree} ) are simulated numerically with the help of a state-of-the-art three-dimensional CFD model. The results show the important role of convective accelerations, induced by point bars, in the redistribution of momentum, dynamics of secondary flows, and the distribution of bed shear stresses. Discussions about implications for sediment transport and river-planform evolution are presented.},

  abstract = {A 2D depth-averaged hydrodynamic, sediment transport and bed morphology model named STREMR HySeD is presented. The depth-averaged sediment transport equations are derived from the 3D dilute, multiphase, flow equations and are incorporated into the hydrodynamic model STREMR. The hydrodynamic model includes a two-equation turbulence model and a correction for the mean flow due to secondary flows. The suspended sediment load can be subdivided into different size classes using the continuum (two-fluid) approach; however, only one bed sediment size is used herein. The validation of the model is presented by comparing the suspended sediment transport module against experimental measurements and analytical solutions for the case of equilibrium sediment-laden in a transition from a rigid bed to a porous bed where re-suspension of sediment is prevented. On the other hand, the bed-load sediment transport and bed evolution numerical results are compared against bed equilibrium experimental results for the case of a meander bend. A sensitivity analysis based on the correction for secondary flow on the mean flow including the effect of secondary flow on bed shear stresses direction as well as the downward acceleration effect due to gravity on transverse bed slopes is performed and discussed. In general, acceptable agreement is found when comparing the numerical results obtained with STREMR HySeD against experimental measurements and analytical solutions.

  abstract = {Streambank erosion is an important management issue, particularly for meandering rivers. Recently, bendway weirs have become popular control measures for bank erosion along small meandering streams in the agricultural Midwest. Although these structures have successfully mitigated bank erosion in some cases, there is evidence that the weirs do not always perform as anticipated. Scientific understanding of how bendway weirs influence flow dynamics, streambank erosion, and aquatic habitat is limited. Current design criteria are based primarily on expert judgment rather than a formalized technical design procedure. At field-scale studies, the present paper represents a first step toward an integrated geomorphological and engineering evaluation of the performance of bendway weirs in rivers. To accomplish this initial phase, three-dimensional ͑3D͒ velocity data were collected on Sugar Creek at Brookside Farm, Ill., and 3D numerical simulations for low-flow conditions were performed to validate the computational fluid dynamic model. Overall results show good agreement between measured and simulated data for streamwise velocities and turbulence kinetic energy. The model is less accurate at predicting the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy in the shear layer immediately downstream from the weir tips. Based on the validation for low-flow condition, 3D simulations were carried out for medium and high flows where the bendway weirs are completely submerged. These simulations indicate that 3D patterns of flow, especially flow near the outer bank, change dramatically with changes in flow stage. Flow patterns at high-flow condition indicate that bank retreat over the tops of weirs is associated with locally high-shear stresses, thus producing a ``shelf'' along the base of the outer bank as observed in the field.},

The model was calibrated using data from an experiment carried out assuming free-draining (FD) outlet conditions, and subsequently validated against data from three experiments assuming blocked-end conditions. The data were analyzed using the Richards' equation for variably saturated flow and either the traditional convection{\textendash} dispersion equation (CDE) or the physical nonequilibrium mobile {\textendash} immobile (MIM) model for solute transport. Optimization was accomplished by means of Levenberg {\textendash} Marquardt optimization in combination with the HYDRUS-2D model. Simultaneous and two-step optimization approaches were used to estimate the soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters near the FD furrow inlet and outlet sites. First, the saturated hydraulic conductivity {\textdh}Ks{\TH} and CDE or MIM solute transport parameters were estimated simultaneously. We also used sequential (two-step) estimation in which we first estimated the soil hydraulic parameters followed by estimation of the solute transport parameters. In the two-step method, the saturated soil water content {\textdh}us{\TH}; the n parameter in van Genuchten's soil water retention model, and Ks values were estimated during the first step, and the CDE or MIM solute transport parameters during the second step.},

  abstract = {Application of integrated hydrological models to manage a watershed's water resources are increasingly finding their way into the decision-making processes. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a multi-process model integrating hydrology, ecology, agriculture, and water quality. SWAT is a continuation of nearly 40 years of modeling efforts conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS). A large number of SWAT-related papers have appeared in ISI journals, building a world-wide consensus around the model's stability and usefulness. The current issue is a collection of the latest research using SWAT as the modeling tool. Most models must undergo calibration/validation and uncertainty analysis. Unfortunately, these sciences are not formal subjects of teaching in most universities and the students are often left to their own resources to calibrate their model. In this paper, we focus on calibration and uncertainty analysis highlighting some serious issues in the calibration of distributed models. A protocol for calibration is also highlighted to guide the users to obtain better modeling results. Finally, a summary of the papers published in this special issue is provided in the Appendix.},

Calculations, field observations and historical evidence show that these jams can form stable structures controlling local channel hydraulics and providing refugia for riparian forest development over decades and possibly centuries. Distinctive spatial patterns of LWD, pools, bars and forested islands form in association with particular jam types. The deposition of `key member' logs initiates the formation of stable bar apex and meander jams that alter the local flow hydraulics and thereby the spatial characteristics of scour and deposition leading to pool and bar formation. Historical evidence and the age structure of forest patches documents the temporal development of alluvial topography associated with these jam types. Bar apex jams, for example, are associated with a crescentic pool, an upstream arcuate bar and a downstream central bar that is the focus of forest patch development. Experimental and empirical studies in hydraulic engineering accurately predict channel scour associated with jams. Individual jams can be remarkably stable, providing long-term bank protection that creates local refugia for mature forest patches within a valley floor environment characterized by rapid channel migration and frequent disturbance. Processes controlling the formation, structure and stability of naturally occurring LWD jams are fundamental to the dynamics of forested river ecosystems and provide insights into the design of both habitat restoration structures and ecosystem-based watershed management.},

  abstract = {First-generation modelling was concerned only with computer adaptations of established, human-friendly methods. In second-generation modelling, on the other hand, methods were used that were more specifically ``computer friendly'', even if ``human-unfriendly'' (e.g., finite-difference and finite-element methods). In third-generation modelling, these methods were incorporated into modelling systems, or ``shells'', with which a model of any area could be constructed and run automatically by the system when provided with a suitably-formatted description of the area and its ancillary conditions. During the course of the second- and third-generation developments, however, modelling became an increasingly specialised and hermetic activity, confined for most practical purposes to computational-hydraulics experts. The fourth generation then builds on this earlier development, but in such a way as to provide modelling systems that can be used by professional engineers who are not computational-hydraulics experts. The paper describes a typical system for fourth-generation modelling, it outlines the manner of transformation of a third-generation system into a fourth-generation system, and it discusses some of the limits of fourth-generation modelling. It is emphasised that fourth-generation modelling demands a serious research commitment that is, however, not scientific research in its usually-understood sense.}

The algorithm has many beneficial properties, including automatic step-size adaptation, efficient covariance updates that incorporates the current samples as well as the evolution path and its invariance properties. Its update rules are composed of well established heuristics where the theoretical foundations of some of these rules are also well understood. In this paper we will fully derive all CMA-ES update rules within the framework of expectation-maximisation-based stochastic search algorithms using information-geometric trust regions. We show that the use of the trust region results in similar updates to CMA-ES for the mean and the covariance matrix while it allows for the derivation of an improved update rule for the step-size. Our new algorithm, Trust-Region Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (TR-CMA-ES) is fully derived from first order optimization principles and performs favourably in compare to standard CMA-ES algorithm.},

The data set used in this study was derived from field experiments conducted with a straight benthic in situ flume in different aquatic environments in New Zealand. The experiments with stepwise increases in flow velocity revealed that peaks in the erosion rate at the beginning of each velocity step are most likely associated with heterogeneous bed structure, as transient hydrodynamic effects due to the experimental procedure were found to be insignificant. The field data showed an exponential decay of the erosion rate with time that is indicative of depth-limited erosion. These data are used to illustrate methods for the parameterization of the proposed semiempirical erosion equation, taking into account the time dependency of the erosion process.},

Early identification of invasive species is necessary in planning, restoring, and managing wetlands. This study assessed the effectiveness of UAV technology to identify invasive Phragmites australis in the Old Woman Creek (OWC) estuary using machine learning (ML) algorithms: Neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (kNN). The ML algorithms were compared with the parametric maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) using pixel- and object-based methods. Pixel-based NN was identified as the best classifier with an overall accuracy of 94.80\% and the lowest error of omission of 1.59\%, the outcome desirable for effective eradication of Phragmites. The results were reached combining Sequoia multispectral imagery (green, red, red edge, and near-infrared bands) combined with the canopy height model (CHM) acquired in the mid-growing season and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) acquired later in the season. The sensitivity analysis, using various vegetation indices, image texture, CHM, and principal components (PC), demonstrated the impact of various feature layers on the classifiers. The study emphasizes the necessity of a suitable sampling and cross-validation methods, as well as the importance of optimum classification parameters.},

  abstract = {The objective of the paper is to study accuracy of multi-class classification in high-dimensional setting, where the number of classes is also large (``large L, large p, small n'' model). While this problem arises in many practical applications and many techniques have been recently developed for its solution, to the best of our knowledge nobody provided a rigorous theoretical analysis of this important setup. The purpose of the present paper is to fill in this gap. We consider one of the most common settings, classification of high-dimensional normal vectors where, unlike standard assumptions, the number of classes could be large. We derive non-asymptotic conditions on effects of significant features, and the low and the upper bounds for distances between classes required for successful feature selection and classification with a given accuracy. Furthermore, we study an asymptotic setup where the number of classes is diverging with the dimension of feature space and while the number of samples per class is possibly limited. We point out on an interesting and, at first glance, somewhat counter-intuitive phenomenon that a large number of classes may be a ``blessing'' rather than a ``curse'' since, in certain settings, the precision of classification can improve as the number of classes grows. This is due to more accurate feature selection since even weaker significant features, which are not sufficiently strong to be manifested in a coarse classification, being shared across the classes, have a stronger impact as the number of classes increases. We supplement our theoretical investigation by a simulation study and a real data example where we again observe the above phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Information on the water quality impact of perennial warm-season grasses (WSGs) when grown in marginal lands as dedicated energy crops is limited. We studied how WSGs affected runoff, sediment, and nutrient losses and related near-surface soil properties to those of no-till corn (Zea mays L.) on an eroded soil in southwestern Iowa and a center pivot corner in east-central Nebraska. The experiment at the eroded soil was established in 2012, and treatments included `Liberty' switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and no-till continuous corn. The experiment at the pivot corner was established in 2013 with `Liberty' switchgrass, `Shawnee' switchgrass, low-diversity grass mixture, and corn. We simulated rainfall at 63.5 {$\pm$} 2.8 mm h-1 for 1 h to portray 5-yr return periods and measured water erosion in spring 2017. Time to runoff start and runoff depth did not differ between WSGs and corn. On the eroded soil, sediment and nutrient losses did not differ between treatments. At the pivot corner, sediment (0.71 vs. 0.15 Mg ha-1) and PO4{\textendash}P (0.037 vs. 0.006 kg ha-1) losses were five times higher in corn than in WSGs. Near-surface soil properties did not differ on the eroded soil, but at the pivot corner, wet aggregate stability was four times higher and residue cover was 34\% higher in WSGs than in corn. Water-stable aggregates were negatively correlated with NO3{\textendash}N and PO4{\textendash}P losses. Overall, WSGs can improve water quality in marginally productive croplands, but their effectiveness appears to be site specific. Core Ideas Warm-season grasses did not reduce runoff depth compared with corn. Warm-season grasses on a center pivot corner reduced sediment and nutrient loss compared with corn. Sediment loss between corn and switchgrass grown in an eroded soil did not differ. Warm-season grass effectiveness to reduce water erosion can be site specific.},

  month = oct,
  abstract = {The current work is embedded in a research project, financed by TIWAG {\textendash} Tiroler Wasserkraft AG, aiming at the application and improvement of 2D fractional bed load transport to an alpine river in the {\"O}tztaler Alps in Tyrol/Austria. The catchment with a size of 890 km{$^2$} ranges from 673 and 3762 masl. of which 13\% are glaciated. The roughly 50 km long main river reach is characterized by several steep sections followed by spacious, populated basins. Focus in the work is put on the long term modeling of bed load transport in an alpine stream coupled with intermittent flood situations. The work aims to come up with an increasingly reliable and stable simulation of the river bed development in alpine environment. Thus, this would allow to not only reconstruct historic situations, but as well to test alterations in the river system. This allows testing for e.g. flood protection measures, changed meteorological situations or the combination of both for an enhanced future preparedness. The used two-dimensional software Hydro\_GS-2D is based on the Finite Volume Method to solve the shallow water equations (Nujic, 2009). The implemented bed load transport model uses a multi-fraction multi-layer approach, with a three layer system. The multi-fraction approach is implemented using the Meyer-Peter \& M{\"u}ller (1949) equation coupled with the hiding function by Hunziker (1995) and Hunziker et al. (2009). The investigations are primarily dealing with the long term morphodynamic simulation of periods of several years, respectively the spring/summer periods being relevant for bed load transport. Where the transport of fine material is dominating over long periods, the modeling approach aims to be capable to simulate increased bed load transport during flood events as well. Overall current and altered erosion and deposition dynamics of the bed shall be simulated. Although significant advances in the field were already made during the last years, the computational demands are a bottle neck of such elaborate modeling approaches. This is even more relevant when larger areas are to be simulated over long periods as it is the case here. A distributed computing approach to reduce simulation times is presented, enabling the spatial and temporal decomposition of simulations. The gained speedup is estimated using simulations of separated test cases. For the calibration of the actual model the initial states at the simulation start are a core issue. The given catchment is exceptionally well covered by field investigations regarding grain size distribution (line-by-number analysis and sieve analysis) and cross section profiles along the main river. Still, the spatially distributed initial grain size distribution and associated skin friction coefficients are altered with time. The temporal variation of the bed roughness is equally important as the initial parameterization. For sake of computational demands an external approach enabling the modification of skin friction and/or roughness coefficient is realized on a section wise basis. As the approach is mostly driven by the actual grain size distribution, the approach is tested in a sub basin under flood flow conditions, bearing the most significant morphological changes. Still, although the required model inputs are best possible estimated, the model results bear a remaining uncertainty.}

  abstract = {Around the world, there is an increasing desire, supported by national and regional policies and legislation, to conserve or restore the ecological health and functioning of rivers and their associated wetlands for human use and biodiversity. To achieve this, many organisations have developed methods for defining ``environmental flows‿, i.e. the flow regime required in a river to achieve desired ecological objectives. This paper reviews the various methods available and suggests a simple categorisation of the methods into four types: look-up tables, desk-top analysis; functional analysis and hydraulic habitat modelling. No method is necessarily better than another; each may be suitable for different applications. Whilst look-up methods are easy and cheap to apply, they can be expensive to develop, are less accurate and more suitable for scoping studies; in contrast, although hydraulic habitat modelling is more expensive to apply, it is suitable for impact assessment at specific sites. Each method would need to be used within a wider decision-support framework. These are generally either objective-based to define a target flow regime for a specific desired river status, or scenario-based to indicate the relative merits of various flow regime options for the river environment.

Typically, numerical 2D models for rivers that involve hydrodynamics, sediment transport and morphology processes are calibrated sequentially under the assumption that the morphology changes do not significantly affect the hydrodynamics. However, in some cases, the morphologic processes modify substantially the hydrodynamic due to the quick bed level accession and erosion as a function of the hydrological regime. These changes require a more efficient procedure reduce the amount of scenarios with indicators that allow to asset the quality of the calibration. This paper shows a methodology proposed to take into account the interaction of hydrodynamic, sedimentology and morphology in rivers based on an experimental design that allow evaluating simultaneously the significance and the sensitivity of the variables in order to select the best set of scenarios based on quantitative and qualitative indicators.},

This paper presents a method based on Design of Experiments theory for calibrating numerical models of rivers by considering the interaction between different calibration parameters, identifying the most sensitive parameters and finding a value or a range of values for which the calibration parameters produces an adequate performance of the model in terms of accuracy. The method consists of a systematic process for assessing the qualitative and quantitative performance of a hydromorphological numeric model. A 75 km reach of the Meta River, in Colombia, was used as case study for validating the method. The modeling was conducted by using the software package MIKE-21C, a two-dimensional flow model. The calibration is assessed by means of an Overall Weighted Indicator, based on the coefficient of determination of the calibration parameters and within a range from 0 to 1. For the case study, the most significant calibration parameters were the sediment transport equation, the riverbed load factor and the suspended load factor. The optimal calibration produced an Overall Weighted Indicator equal to 0.857. The method can be applied to any type of morphological models.},

Second, in a stochastic framework using the statistical characteristics of inflow and outflow discharges, a projection of future sedimentation was performed until 2030, assuming stationarity of the statistical distributions.

Such models can predict alteration to a river physical habitat caused by hydropower operation or river training. They are a tool for water management planning, especially in terms of requirements of the Water Framework Directive. Therefore, model verification studies, which investigate the accuracy and reliability of the results generated, are essential. An electrofishing survey was conducted in September 2014 on the Stura di Demonte River located in north-western Italy. One hundred and sixteen bullhead{\textemdash}Cottus gobio L.{\textemdash}were captured in 80 pre-exposed area electrofishing (PAE) grids. Observations of bullhead distribution in various habitats were used to validate MesoHABSIM model predictions created with inductive and deductive habitat suitability indices. The inductive statistical models used electrofishing data obtained from multiple mountainous streams, analyzed with logistic regression. The deductive approach was based on conditional habitat suitability criteria (CHSC) derived from expert knowledge and information gathered from the literature about species behaviour and habitat use. The results of model comparison and validation show that although the inductive models are more precise and reflect site- and species-specific characteristics, the CHSC model provides quite similar results. We propose to use inductive models for detailed planning of measures that could potentially impair riverine ecosystems at a local scale, since the CHSC model provides general information about habitat suitability and use of such models is advised in pre-development or generic scale studies. However, the CHSC model can be further calibrated with localized electrofishing data at a lower cost than development of an inductive model.},

Automatic calibration as the process to determine the parameters appearing in the equations of a 2-dimensional, hydrodynamic, and water quality models (CEQUAL-W2) is carried out with Particle Swarm technique as an optimization tool. In the calibration of the CE-QUAl-W2 model, evaporation as a significant parameter influences the thermal profile and water surface elevation in reservoir, simultaneously. Therefore to consider the simultaneous effects of the water temperature variations on water surface elevation in the reservoir, a multi objective technique is used to minimize the weighted sum of total deviations of temperature from field data at check points on monitoring days and those of water surface elevation on daily monitoring period. The proposed approach overcomes the high computational efforts required if a conventional calibration search technique was used, while retaining the quality of the final calibration results. The automatic calibration approach is applied in temperature and water budget calibration of Karkheh reservoir in Iran. Applying the proposed automatic calibration approach, shows the produced results by the CE-QUAL-W2 model with the calibrated coefficients agree closely with a set of field data.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, the calibration of groundwater models has depended on gradient-based local optimization methods. These methods provide a reasonable degree of success only when the objective function is smooth, second-order differentiable, and satisfies the Lipschitz's condition. For complicated and highly nonlinear objective functions it is almost impractical to satisfy these conditions simultaneously. Research in the calibration of conceptual rainfall-runoff models, has shown that global optimization methods are more successful in locating the global optimum in the region of multiple local optima. In this study, a global optimization technique, known as shuffle complex evolution (SCE), is coupled to the gradient-based Lavenberg{\textendash}Marquardt algorithm (GBLM). The resultant hybrid global optimization algorithm (SCEGB) is then deployed in parallel testing with SCE and GBLM to solve several inverse problems where parameters of a nonlinear numerical groundwater flow model are estimated. Using perfect (i.e. noise-free) observation data, it is shown SCEGB and SCE are successful at identifying the global optimum and predicting all model parameters; whereas, the commonly applied GBLM fails to identify the optimum. In subsequent inverse simulations using observation data corrupted with noise, SCEGB and SCE again outperform GBLM by consistently producing more accurate parameter estimates. Finally, in all simulations the hybrid SCEGB is seen to be equally effective as SCE but computationally more efficient.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new version of the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) algorithm for solving parameter identification problems. The SCE divides a population into several parallel subsets called complex and then improves each sub-complex through an evolutionary process using a Nelder{\textendash}Mead (NM) simplex search method. This algorithm applies its evolutionary process only on the worst member of each sub-complex whereas the role of other members is not operative. Therefore, the number and variety of search moves are limited in the evolutionary process of SCE. The current study focuses to overcome this drawback by proposing a corporate SCE (CSCE). This algorithm provides an evolutionary possibility for all members of a sub-complex. In the CSCE, each member is influenced by a simplex made from all other members of the current sub-complex. The CSCE barrows three actions of NM, i.e. reflection, contraction and expansion, and applied them on each member to find a better candidate than the current one. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is first tested on six benchmark problems. After achieving satisfactory performance on the test problems, it is applied to parameter identification problems and the obtained results are compared with some other algorithms reported in the literature. Numerical results and non-parametric analysis show that the proposed algorithm is very effective and robust since it produces similar and promising results over repeated runs.},

In particular, this paper proposes a 2D depth-averaged model that takes into account the influence of the secondary flow phenomenon through calculation of the dispersion stresses. The dispersion terms which arose from the integration of the product of the discrepancy between the mean and the actual vertical velocity distribution were included in the momentum equations in order to take into account the effect of the secondary current. This model used a time-splitting method for solving advection, diffusion and other momentum equation terms. The proposed model uses an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system efficiently and accurately to simulate the flow field with irregular boundaries; it also used a finite volume projection method approach for solving the governing equation in a staggered grid. Two sets of experimental data were used to demonstrate the model's capabilities. The comparison of the simulated water surface elevation with the measurements shows good agreement and indicates that inclusion of the dispersion terms improved the simulation results.},

These estimates span the range of laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow regimes. All equations take advantage of the fact that the fall velocity Reynolds number is a function of only one variable, the Archimedes buoyancy index. Adjusting the coefficients can make a significant improvement in the fit of these equations to data. In the commonly used beach equilibrium profile model, hϭApx2/3, the sediment scale parameter Ap , is usually tabulated as a function of grain diameter. It will be shown that the normalized sediment scale parameter Ap /d1/3 is also a function of only the Archimedes buoyancy index. This research indicates that the Archimedes buoyancy index is the fundamental independent variable for both the fall velocity Reynolds number and the normalized sediment scale parameter. Calculating the Archimedes buoyancy index is facilitated by some simple equations, which in turn allow easy computation of fall velocity and sediment scale parameter.},

The model incorporates the suspended-load transport module and the bed-load transport module to simulate sediment transport and employs the sediment continuity equation to calculate channel bed evolution. The numerical simulation is performed in a meandering channel with a movable bed, in which the suspended load is comparable to the bed load. The model captures the main features of the bathymetry at equilibrium conditions. The streamwise velocity profiles and the suspended sediment concentration profiles at equilibrium conditions are also predicted by this simulation, and the agreement with the measured data is generally reasonable. The influence of including the suspended load is revealed by the comparison between the results obtained with total-load model and bed-load model in the meandering channel.

This work presents the impact of middle vanes on the water depth changes (super-elevation) in sharp bends. The behavior of these vanes while extending the up- and downstream channels is also investigated. Various experiments are conducted to verify the laboratory model, guarantee homogeneity of the data, and minimize the systematic errors. Accordingly, the water depth values are measured for three 30◦, 60◦, and 90◦ bends with various inlet discharges for gauging sections throughout and after the bend. It is found that, unlike mild bends, super-elevation in sharp bends is nonlinear. Moreover, the vanes shift the location of the maximum and minimum depths from the bisector toward the end of the bends. Vanes are able to decrease the super-elevation while their efficiency can be improved up to 90\% by extending them into the up- and downstream channels. A new equation is also proposed to determine the maximum water depth gradients.},

This paper describes calibration procedures for water-quantity parameters of the HSPF version 10{\DH}11 using the automatic-calibration parameter estimator model coupled with a geographical information system (GIS) approach for spatially averaged properties. The study area was the Grand River watershed, located in southern Ontario, Canada, between 79{\textdegree} 300 and 80{\textdegree} 570 W longitude and 42{\textdegree} 510 and 44{\textdegree} 310 N latitude. The drainage area is 6965 km2. Calibration efforts were directed to those model parameters that produced large changes in model response during sensitivity tests run prior to undertaking calibration. A GIS was used extensively in this study. It was first used in the watershed segmentation process. During calibration, the GIS data were used to establish realistic starting values for the surface and subsurface zone parameters LZSN, UZSN, COVER, and INFILT and physically reasonable ratios of these parameters among watersheds were preserved during calibration with the ratios based on the known properties of the subwatersheds determined using GIS. This calibration procedure produced very satisfactory results; the percentage difference between the simulated and the measured yearly discharge ranged between 4 to 16\%, which is classified as good to very good calibration. The average simulated daily discharge for the watershed outlet at Brantford for the years 1981{\textendash}85 was 67 m3 s 1 and the average measured discharge at Brantford was 70 m3 s 1. The coupling of a GIS with automatice calibration produced a realistic and accurate calibration for the HSPF model with much less effort and subjectivity than would be required for unassisted calibration.

  abstract = {Soil erosion, sediment yield, and sediment transport associated with flash flooding in arid regions result in reservoir storage losses, decreased infiltration, high evaporation rates, and degradation of downstream channels. However, the lack of observational data from wadi systems and an empirical formula to compute sediment yield has hindered reservoir trapping evaluation, maintenance, and management. Therefore, this research aimed to estimate the annual soil loss in the upstream catchment area of a reservoir based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with a remote sensing dataset. The sediment trapped in the Assarin Dam reservoir in Oman was estimated by coupling unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys with photogrammetry analysis to assess the reservoir siltation. Among the previous sediment trapping events, seven sets of field observation data were collected to investigate the relationship between soil loss at the catchment scale and sediment deposition volumes in the reservoir. The RUSLE method was applied to estimate soil erosion using independent factors such as rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, topography, cover management and conservation practices. A remote sensing dataset and geographic information system (GIS) environments were used to analyse the quantitative and spatial distribution of the RUSLE parameters. Two drone surveys were conducted over the reservoir before and after a flash flood. The trapped sediment volume was estimated to be approximately 9,075~m3 (11,343 ton) per event, representing approximately 1.26~\% of the total reservoir capacity. This computed volume was validated using measurements from monitored sediment scale bars sited throughout the Assarin Dam reservoir, yielding an accuracy of 79~\%. From the RUSLE results, the annual soil erosion was estimated to be 196,599 ton/ha yr-1, of which approximately 5.8~\% was trapped in the reservoir. Spatial-temporal variability in the rainfall patterns and the corresponding runoff discharges led to high sediment delivery at the outlet of the basin. After analysing available data from previous field surveys in Oman, a new formula for estimating the sediment yield in Wadi Assarin was developed. The results of this research, which represent the first of their type in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, can support reservoir management practices and show that UAV-based photogrammetry is suitable for measuring trapped sediment volumes.},

SSC was determined as a by-product of the echo profiles along the horizontal aligned acoustic beams emitted by H-ADCPs. For the first time, the effect of organic matter other than a change of inorganic particles size distribution was evaluated as a possible reason for backscatter and attenuation variations during hydrological events. This reduced average deviations between acoustically inferred and sampled concentrations from 1 order of magnitude to 20\% of actual values. The improvement required the measuring of attenuation to backscatter ratio (ABR) in addition to sound attenuation. The validation interval covered 3 orders of magnitude from 10-1 to 10 g L-1. In this paper the potential of the ABR method using H-ADCP to continuously monitor suspended sediment fluxes is tested in two different rivers, enabling single peak flood analysis and reliable assessment of sediment budget across a river cross section.

  abstract = {To give soils and soil degradation, which are among the most crucial threats to ecosystem stability, social and political visibility, small and large scale modelling and mapping of soil erosion is inevitable. The most widely used approaches during an 80year history of erosion modelling are Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE)-type based algorithms which have been applied in 109 countries. Addressing soil erosion by water (excluding gully erosion and land sliding), we start this review with a statistical evaluation of nearly 2,000 publications). We discuss model developments which use USLE-type equations as basis or side modules, but we also address recent development of the single USLE parameters (R, K, LS, C, P). Importance, aim and limitations of model validation as well as a comparison of USLE-type models with other erosion assessment tools are discussed. Model comparisons demonstrate that the application of process-based physical models (e.g., WEPP or PESERA) does not necessarily result in lower uncertainties compared to more simple structured empirical models such as USLE-type algorithms. We identified four key areas for future research: (i) overcoming the principally different nature of modelled (gross) versus measured (net) erosion rates, in coupling on-site erosion risk to runoff patterns, and depositional regime, (ii) using the recent increase in spatial resolution of remote sensing data to develop process based models for large scale applications, (iii) strengthen and extend measurement and monitoring programs to build up validation data sets, and (iv) rigorous uncertainty assessment and the application of objective evaluation criteria to soil erosion modelling.},

Both cases involve channel flows directed into a desilting basin, where the main current changes from one part of the geometry to the other. The CFD computations are validated with field or laboratory measurements. The first case presented is one of the sand traps of Khimti hydro power plant in Nepal. According to the laboratory measurements, the recirculation zone for this case is close to the bed, with the main current following the water surface. This is reproduced by the numerical model when using a first-order upwind scheme. Using a second-order upwind scheme, the main current is close to the bed, and the recirculation is formed at the surface. The second case is one of the sand traps of Tonstad hydro power plant in Norway. CFD computations predict the main flow field to follow the right or the left sides or the centre of the expansion region, depending on the discretization scheme, grid resolution and turbulence model. Field measurements show that the main current follows the centre of the expansion zone.},

  abstract = {With the increasing attention on environmental flow management for the maintenance of habitat diversity and ecosystem health of mountain gravel-bed rivers, much interest has been paid to how inter-flood low flow can affect gravel-bed river morphodynamics during subsequent flood events. Previous research has found that antecedent conditioning flow can lead to an increase in critical shear stress and a reduction in sediment transport rate during a subsequent flood. However, how long this effect can last during the flood event has not been fully discussed. In this paper, a series of flume experiments with various durations of conditioning flow are presented to study this problem. Results show that channel morphology adjusts significantly within the first 15 min of the conditioning flow but becomes rather stable during the remainder of the conditioning flow. The implementation of conditioning flow can indeed lead to a reduction of sediment transport rate during the subsequent hydrograph, but such an effect is limited to within a relatively short time at the beginning of the hydrograph. This indicates that bed reorganization during the conditioning phase, which induces the stress history effect, is likely to be erased with increasing intensity of flow and sediment transport during the subsequent flood event.},

  abstract = {Groundwater pollution source identification (GPSI) provides information about the temporal and spatial distribution of pollution sources and helps decision makers design pollution remediation plans to protect the groundwater environment. The Bayesian approach based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach provides an efficient framework for GPSI. However, MCMC sampling entails multiple model calls to converge to the posterior probability distribution of unknown pollution source parameters and entails a massive computational load if the simulation model is directly called. This study aimed to develop an innovative framework in which an improved MCMC approach was linked to a surrogate model. Sensitivity analysis was incorporated into the MH-MCMC approach, named SAMH-MCMC (sensitivity analysis based Metropolis Hastings-Markov Chain Monte Carlo), to speed up the convergence of the posterior distribution in a novel way to control the search step size. Three computationally inexpensive surrogate models for the simulation model were proposed: support vector regression, Kriging (KRG), and multilayer perceptron, and the most accurate model was chosen. The feasibility and advantages of the developed framework were evaluated and validated through two hypothetical numerical cases with homogenous and heterogeneous media. The proposed approach has strong convergence robustness as it considers the sensitivities of the unknown parameters that characterise groundwater pollution sources and can achieve high identification accuracy. Furthermore, the KRG surrogate model has a higher accuracy than other surrogate models, owing to its linear unbiased estimation characteristic. Overall, the framework developed in this study is a promising solution for identifying groundwater pollution source parameters.},

  abstract = {We investigate the entrainment, deposition and motion of coarse spherical particles within a turbulent shallow water stream down a steep slope. This is an idealization of bed-load transport in mountain streams. Earlier investigations have described this kind of sediment transport using empirical correlations or concepts borrowed from continuum mechanics. The intermittent character of particle transport at low-water discharges led us to consider it as a random process. Sediment transport in this regime results from the imbalance between entrainment and deposition of particles rather than from momentum balance between water and particles. We develop a birth{\textendash}death immigration{\textendash}emigration Markov process to describe the particle exchanges between the bed and the water stream. A key feature of the model is its long autocorrelation times and wide, frequent fluctuations in the solid discharge, a phenomenon never previously explained despite its ubiquity in both nature and laboratory experiments. We present experimental data obtained using a nearly two-dimensional channel and glass beads as a substitute for sediment. Entrainment, trajectories, and deposition were monitored using a high-speed digital camera. The empirical probability distributions of the solid discharge and deposition frequency were properly described by the theoretical model. Experiments confirmed the existence of wide and frequent fluctuations of the solid discharge, and revealed the existence of long autocorrelation time, but theory overestimates the autocorrelation times by a factor of around three. Particle velocity was weakly dependent on the fluid velocity contrary to the predictions of the theoretical model, which performs well when a single particle is moving. For our experiments, the dependence of the solid discharge on the fluid velocity is entirely controlled by the number of moving particles rather than by their velocity. We also noted significant changes in the behaviour of particle transport when the bed slope or the water discharge was increased. The more vigorous the stream was, the more continuous the solid discharge became. Moreover, although 90\% of the energy supplied by gravity to the stream is dissipated by turbulence for slopes lower than 10\%, particles dissipate more and more energy when the bed slope is increased, but surprisingly, the dissipation rate is nearly independent of fluid velocity.

  abstract = {This paper outlines the various approaches used to calculate bedload transport. As bedload transport exhibits considerable spatial and temporal variations, computing the bedload transport rates and morphological changes experienced by streambeds is difficult. A large body of experimental work has revealed scaling laws relating the mean transport rate qs to hydraulic conditions (that is, water discharge qw, bottom shear stress {$\tau$}b or stream power {$\omega$}): qs{$\propto$}qw, qs{$\propto\tau$}b3/2 or qs{$\propto\omega$}. The most common approach used to calculate bedload transport has thus long involved determining the one-to-one function qs=f(qw) (or any other dependence of qs on {$\tau$}b or {$\omega$}) from experiments or theoretical considerations. However, the predictive power of such relationships is limited: scientists are unable to predict qs to within better than one order of magnitude, and morphodynamic models based on qs=f(qw) fail to explain the development of bedforms without the use of additional assumptions. Progressively, other calculation approaches have appeared, with many relying on the idea that bedload transport is a macroscopic transport process that primarily reflects random particle motion at the grain scale. The present paper reviews the main ideas being explored today.},

  abstract = {By the late nineteenth century, the scientific study of bedload transport had emerged as an offshoot of hydraulics and geomorphology. Since then, computing bedload transport rates has attracted considerable attention, but whereas other environmental sciences have seen their predictive capacities grow over time, particularly thanks to increased computing power, engineers and scientists are unable to predict bedload transport rates to within better than one order of magnitude. Why have we failed to improve our predictive capacity to any significant degree? A commonly shared view is that the study of bedload transport has more in common with the earth sciences than hydraulics: bedload transport rates depend on many processes that vary nonlinearly, involve various time and space scales, and are interrelated to each other. All this makes it difficult to view bedload as merely particle transport in a turbulent flow {\textendash} something which can be studied in the laboratory in isolation from the natural environment. Over the last two decades, more emphasis has been put on the noisy dynamics characterizing bedload transport. This Vision Paper makes a strong case for recognizing noise (e.g. bedload transport rate fluctuations) as an intrinsic feature of bedload transport. Improving our predictive capacities requires a better understanding of the origins and nature of noise in bedload transport. This paper also reviews some of the challenges that need to be addressed in current research and teaching.},

Inferring bedload transport's scaling behavior from data has remained a stubborn problem because the data are very noisy. It is, therefore, difficult to progress on this problem without some informed speculation about how bedload and flow interact. Ralph Bagnold proposed an original theory to resolve this problem. This paper reviews and updates Bagnold's model by separating the effects of flow resistance and efficiency (energy transfer from water to bedload) on dimensionless transport rates {$\Phi$}. Both variables' contributions to transport rates can be parameterized separately for the three transport regimes that Bagnold defined (no transport, transitional, and sheet flow). We also consider two possible control variables: the dimensionless Shield stress {$\tau\ast$} and a dimensionless number related to stream power. In the transitional regime, the dimensionless bedload transport rate scales as {$\Phi\propto\tau\ast$}3, whereas in the sheet-flow regime, it varies as {$\Phi\propto\tau\ast$}5/3. We end up with two Bagnold equations: one based on physical principles and involving Shields stress {$\tau\ast$}, flow resistance f, a density ratio, and a bed slope; the other based on non-linear regression and stream power. Compared to a large set of laboratory and field data, predictions from Bagnold's model show reasonable accuracy when the bed is plane.},

  abstract = {Understanding and predicting bedload transport is an important element of watershed management. Yet, predictions of bedload remain uncertain by up to several order(s) of magnitude. In this contribution, we use a 5-year continuous time series of streamflow and bedload transport monitoring in a 13.4-km2 snow-dominated Alpine watershed in the Western Swiss Alps to investigate hydrological drivers of bedload transport. Following a calibration of the bedload sensors, and a quantification of the hydraulic forcing of streamflow upon bedload, a hydrological analysis is performed to identify daily flow hydrographs influenced by different hydrological drivers: rainfall, snowmelt, and combined rain and snowmelt events. We then quantify their respective contribution to bedload transport. Results emphasize the importance of combined rain and snowmelt events, for both annual bedload volumes (77\% on average) and peaks in bedload transport rate. A non-negligible, but smaller, amount of bedload transport may occur during late summer and autumn storms, once the snowmelt contribution and baseflow have significantly decreased (9\% of the annual volume on average). Although rainfall-driven changes in flow hydrographs are responsible for a large majority of the annual bedload volumes (86\% on average), the identified melt-only events also represent a substantial contribution (14\% on average). The results of this study help to improve current predictions of bedload transport through a better understanding of the bedload magnitude-frequency relationship under different hydrological conditions. We further discuss how bedload transport could evolve under a changing climate through its effects on Alpine watershed hydrology.},

This has resulted in a statistical fit of predictions to observations that is a clear improvement (average coefficient of efficiency for daily flow at 20 locations increased from 0.50 to 0.79, average percent flow volume difference at 20 locations reduced from 91\% to 15\%). This calibration also satisfies the modellers need for an acceptable visual fit.

The approach is based on the conservation of the mass of water and sediments and on the energy balance under steady conditions. It leads to a relationship among opening width, sediment characteristics, mountain river geometry, and water and sediment discharge. The final relationship can be simplified to make it suitable for practical applications. Also, the problem of unsteadiness of both water and sediment is considered, as well as the possibility of treating the unsteady flow as a sequence of steady states. The results of the theory were checked in a laboratory investigation using a scale model. Different opening widths were tested under conditions of steady and unsteady supplies of water and sediment. The mean grain size of the sediment, as well as the rates of sediment and water discharge, were changed in the experiments. The results of the experiments confirm the theory quite well.},

  abstract = {Across High Asia, the amount, timing, and spatial patterns of snow and ice melt play key roles in providing water for downstream irrigation, hydropower generation, and general consumption. The goal of this paper is to distinguish the specific contribution of seasonal snow versus glacier ice melt in the major basins of High Mountain Asia: Ganges, Brahmaputra, Indus, Amu Darya, and Syr Darya. Our methodology involves the application of MODIS-derived remote sensing products to separately calculate daily melt outputs from snow and glacier ice. Using an automated partitioning method, we generate daily maps of (1) snow over glacier ice, (2) exposed glacier ice, and (3) snow over land. These are inputs to a temperature index model that yields melt water volumes contributing to river flow. Results for the five major High Mountain Asia basins show that the western regions are heavily reliant on snow and ice melt sources for summer dry season flow when demand is at a peak, whereas monsoon rainfall dominates runoff during the summer period in the east. While uncertainty remains in the temperature index model applied here, our approach to partitioning melt from seasonal snow and glacier ice is both innovative and systematic and more constrained than previous efforts with similar goals.},

  abstract = {The reconstruction of long-term ({$>$}100\,yr) channel changes is critical to understanding how natural and anthropogenic factors impact the evolution of river systems. It provides information on channel sensitivity and the limitations for channel repair in a functional river restoration context. This study presents a two-century analysis of the evolution of a large braided and anabranching river, the Upper Rhine downstream of Basel, which has experienced three phases of engineering works (nineteenth century channelization, 1930s groyne construction, and 1950s damming and by-passing). We studied historical maps, longitudinal profiles, and cross sections to investigate changes in the areas and geometries of fluvial features from 1828 to 2009. The results showed a drastic floodplain drying out following nineteenth century channelization (93\% reduction of fully connected channels, 48\% augmentation of partially connected channels, augmentation of disconnected water bodies by more than five times, and augmentation of terrestrialized channels of more than two times; 1828{\textendash}1925). Changes propagated downstream at 280\,m\,yr-1 on the 50-km long river continuum. The channel exhibited bed topography of large forms in 1880, with a median pool-riffle amplitude of 4.0\,m, locally reaching 6.6\,m. Among the three phases of engineering works on the Upper Rhine, channelization had the most impact on planform (floodplain terrestrialization) and vertical (7\,cm\,yr-1 bed degradation) adjustments, with short reaction times and effects lasting several decades. Damming had the greatest impact on peak flows, and can explain the lower magnitude of the channel changes in the contemporary period. We synthetized the complex cause-effect relationships between natural/anthropogenic controlling factors and hydromorphological processes over the past 200\,yr, and outlined the evolutionary trend of the main geomorphic variables, which can be used as a knowledge framework to evaluate future morphodynamic restoration schemes.},

However, despite important achievements in this area in the last 10 years, significant levels of skill are only generally found over regions strongly connected with the El Nin{\texttildelow} o{\textendash}Southern Oscillation. With the aim of improving the skill of regional climate predictions in tropical and extratropical regions from intraseasonal to interannual time scales, a new Met Office global seasonal forecasting system (GloSea4) has been developed. This new system has been designed to be flexible and easy to upgrade so it can be fully integrated within the Met Office model development infrastructure. Overall, the analysis here shows an improvement of GloSea4 when compared to its predecessor. However, there are exceptions, such as the increased model biases that contribute to degrade the skill of Nin{\texttildelow} o-3.4 SST forecasts starting in November. Global ENSO teleconnections and Madden{\textendash}Julian oscillation anomalies are well represented in GloSea4. Remote forcings of the North Atlantic Oscillation by ENSO and the quasi-biennial oscillation are captured albeit the anomalies are weaker than those found in observations. Hindcast length issues and their implications for seasonal forecasting are also discussed.},

Optimization algorithm performance was compared for each of the available basin-model combinations. For each model-basin pair, 40 calibrations were run with the 10 algorithms. Results were tested for statistical significance using a multicomparison procedure based on Friedman and Kruskal-Wallis tests. A dispersion metric was used to evaluate the fitness landscape underlying the structure on each test case. The trials revealed that the dimensionality and general fitness landscape characteristics of the model calibration problem are important when considering the use of an automatic optimization method. The ASA, CMAES, and DDS algorithms were either as good as or better than the other methods for finding the lowest minimum, with ASA being consistently among the best. The SCE{\textendash}UA method performs better when the model complexity is reduced, whereas the opposite is true for DDS. Convergence speed was also studied, and the same three methods (CMAES, DDS, and ASA) were shown to converge faster than the other methods. The SCE{\textendash}UA method converged nearly as fast as the best methods when the model with the smallest parameter space was used but was not as worthy in the higher-dimension parameter space of the other models. Convergence speed has little impact on algorithm efficiency. The methods offering the worst performance were DE, CS, GA, HS, and PSO, although they did manage to find good local minima in some trials. However, the other available methods generally outperformed these algorithms. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584 .0000938. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

We argue that such approaches are misguided and will ultimately contribute to further degradation of river ecosystems. In the absence of detailed empirical information of environmental flow requirements for rivers, we propose a generic approach that incorporates essential aspects of natural flow variability shared across particular classes of rivers that can be validated with empirical biological data and other information in a calibration process. We argue that this approach can bridge the gap between simple hydrological ``rules of thumb'' and more comprehensive environmental flow assessments and experimental flow restoration projects.},

  abstract = {Soil erosion involves detachment and transport of soil particles from top soil layers, degrading soil quality and reducing the productivity of affected lands. Soil eroded from the upland catchment causes depletion of fertile agricultural land and the resulting sediment deposited at the river networks creates river morphological change and reservoir sedimentation problems. However, land managers and policy makers are more interested in the spatial distribution of soil erosion risk than in absolute values of soil erosion loss. The aims of this paper is to model the spatial distribution of soil erosion in Densu River Basin of Ghana using RUSLE and GIS tools and to use the model to explore the relationship between erosion susceptibility, slope and Land use and Land Cover (LULC) in the Basin. The rainfall map, digital elevation model, soil type map, and land cover map, were input data in the soil erosion model developed. This model was then categorized into four different erosion risk classes. The developed soil erosion map was then overlaid with the slope and LULC maps of the of the study area to explore their effects on erosion susceptibility of the soil in the Densu River Basin. The Model, predicted 88\% of the basin as low erosion risk and 6\% as moderate erosion risk3\% as high erosion risk and 3\% as severe risk. The high and severe erosion areas were distributed mainly within the areas of high slope gradient and also sections of the moderate forest LULC class. Also, the areas within the moderate forest LULC class found to have high erosion risk had an intersecting high erodibility soil group.},

  abstract = {Estimates of fluvial sediment discharge from in situ instruments are an important component of large-scale sediment budgets that track long-term geomorphic change. Suspended sediment load can be reliably estimated using acoustic or physical sampling techniques; however, bedload is difficult to measure directly and can consequently be one of the largest sources of uncertainty in estimates of total load. We propose a physically informed predictive empirical model for bedload sand flux as a function of variables that are measured using existing acoustic or physical sampling techniques. This model depends on the assumption that concentration and grain size in suspension are in equilibrium with reach-averaged boundary conditions. Bayesian inference is used to fit model parameters to data from eight sand-bed rivers and to simulate bedload flux over the available gage record at one site on the Colorado River in Grand Canyon National Park. We find that the cumulative bedload flux during the 9 year period from 2008 to 2016 was 5\% of the cumulative suspended sand load; however, instantaneous bedload flux ranged from as little as 1\% of instantaneous suspended sand load to as much as 75\% of instantaneous suspended sand load due to fluctuations in flow strength and sediment supply. Changes in bedload flux at a constant discharge are indicative of short-term sediment supply enrichment and depletion. Long-term average bedload flux cannot be expected to remain constant in the future as the river adjusts to changes in sediment runoff and the dam-regulated discharge regime.},

  abstract = {Water resources development and management is imperative for sustainable agriculture in water scarce areas. In Pakistan, the state of Punjab has constructed 32 small dams, in the Pothwar region, to store and conserve water for agricultural production. However, little information is available on the impact of these small dams on agriculture and socio-economic conditions of the area. This study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of three small dams, Jawa, Kasala and Dhok Sanday Mar, on agriculture and groundwater development in the area and to provide guidelines for the effective utilization and sustainable management of small dams in Pakistan. Data related to on-farm practices were collected during personal interviews using a pre-tested questionnaire. Water-table depth was measured from the open wells in the area with a water-table recorder. Secondary data such as inflow, outflow, rainfall, water charges and land use were collected from small dams organization. After the construction of these dams and irrigation canals, cropping intensity and crop yield have increased. Due to availability of irrigation water there has been a shift of cropping pattern from wheat and forage crops to vegetable crops. Farmers are earning up to \$2433 per ha per year. An analysis of inflow{\textendash}outflow of the dams shows that, if properly managed, the storage is sufficient to irrigate all the crop lands within the command area. The depth to the water table has also decreased since the dams were constructed. The water table varies from 6 to 15m in the irrigated areas served by the Khasala dam as compared to 7{\textendash}39m before the dam was constructed. The water table depths for the areas served by the Jawa dam ranged from 7 to 39m before the dam was constructed to 9{\textendash}25m after construction. The shallower water table has made the groundwater accessible and as a result the number of wells has increased. This has reduced drudgery on the local inhabitants particularly for women who had to fetch water from far away for their domestic uses. The area has potential for expanding both land use and cropping intensities, if innovative irrigation and agronomic practices are adopted. Moreover, mobilizing local water user associations, proper maintenance of irrigation infrastructure and technical support of the agricultural and extension services can enhance the productivity in the area.},

As wash load is a non-capacity load it often is modelled using empirical relations, such as the rating curve technique. Sediment rating curves in the form of a power function are derived for several locations along the river Rhine and its main tributaries, using different fitting procedures. Inaccuracies in estimated sediment loads are analysed, and spatial differences in the shapes of the fitted rating curves are related to watershed characteristics. Rating curves obtained by least squares regression on logarithmic transformed data underestimate long-term sediment transport rates by 10{\textendash}50\%. Better estimates are obtained when nonlinear least squares regression is applied. The steepness of the fitted rating curves decreases along the main channel of the Rhine in a downstream direction. Contrary to what is generally believed this is not related to changes in the sediment transport regime. A better indication of the sediment transport regime is obtained when the slope/intercept pairs of the fitted rating curves are plotted in a graph. All locations that plot on the same line have a common discharge-concentration value and appear to be characterised by a similar sediment transport regime. At locations of which the slope/intercept pairs plot on higher lines, a larger part of the annual sediment load is transported during high discharge.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to estimate the potential effects of changes in climate and land use on the mobilization of fine sediment and the net transport of wash load from the upstream basin to the lower Rhine delta. For this purpose, a suite of geographical information system-embedded models was developed that simulates the production, and transport of wash load through the drainage network and deposition on floodplains along the lower river reaches. The model results indicate that if climate changes in accordance with the UKHI climate-change scenario, in combination with land use changes, erosion rates will increase in the Alps and decrease in the German part of the basin. Averaged over the entire basin, erosion will increase by about 12\%. However, due to inefficient sediment delivery, increasing erosion in the Alps will have little effect on the sediment load further downstream. In the delta area, sediment loads are expected to decrease by 13\%. When changes in river discharge are accounted for, it appears that, although very high discharges are expected to occur more frequently, sedimentation on floodplains tends to decrease. This is caused mainly by reduced sediment loads at discharges during which the floodplains are just inundated and trapping efficiencies are high.

This hyperbolic system of conservation laws is solved on unstructured meshes by a kinetic scheme based on a finite volume approach. An important property of this scheme is the preservation of the water height positivity when applications with dry areas are considered. Following some hypothesis an entropy inequality is proved. The standard kinetic scheme is modified to deal with varying bed slope and particularly to preserve equilibrium states such as still water. Moreover the source terms due to the arbitrary bottom topography have to be discretized in such a way to balance the flux gradients for these equilibriums. We illustrate the properties of the scheme on different test cases for which exact solutions are available and on more realistic applications.},

Most of this C influx is returned to the atmosphere from inland waters as carbon dioxide (CO2) or buried in sedimentary deposits within impoundments, lakes, floodplains, and other wetlands. Carbon and mineral cycles are coupled by both erosion{\textendash}deposition processes and chemical weathering, with the latter producing dissolved inorganic C and carbonate buffering capacity that strongly modulate downstream pH, biological production of calcium-carbonate shells, and CO2 outgassing in rivers, estuaries, and coastal zones.

However, the effects of such structures on flow hydraulics have not been considered much until now. In this study, the effects of slit-check dams on the flow hydraulics were investigated experimentally and numerically. First, the check-dam blocks of different sizes were placed in an open channel and their hydraulic behavior under subcritical flow conditions was experimentally investigated. Then, the blocks used in the experiments were simulated in a three-dimensional numerical environment using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) under the same flow conditions. Water surface profiles, energy dissipation ratios and velocity profiles obtained from numerical and experimental models were presented and discussed. In the verification of the numerical model, it was observed that the relative error percentage found between the models for different discharges in range of 4\% and 8\%. The results show that a slit-check dam composed of blocks placed in a subcritical flow causes a significant hydraulic jump in the flow. For the 0.8 of the relative block thickness (t/s), the hydraulic jump was found to be the most effective. Total energy loss reached 30\%, and the maximum energy loss was obtained for t/s\,=\,1.0 of the relative block thickness. As conclusion that slit-check dams with blocks are effective in flow regulation under flood and normal flow conditions besides holding large solid materials.},

The purpose of this paper is to assess the impacts of climate change on streamflow and sediment yield from the Gorganroud river basin in the North of Iran. To study the effects of climatic variations, the SWAT model was implemented to simulate the hydrological regime and the SUFI-2 algorithm was used for parameter optimization. The climate change scenarios were constructed using the outcomes of three general circulation models for three emission scenarios. The study results for 2040{\textendash}2069 showed an increase in annual streamflow of 5.8\%, 2.8\% and 9.5\% and an increase in sediment yield of 47.7\%, 44.5\% and 35.9\% for the A1F1, A2 and B1 emission scenarios, respectively. This implies that the impact of climate change on sediment yield is greater than on streamflow. Monthly variations show that the increase in discharge and sediment yield is more pronounced in wet seasons and the decrease is more pronounced in summer (July{\textendash}September). The results highlighted the strong impact of climate change and reflected the importance of incorporating such analysis into adaptive management. Editor Z.W.

Similarly, the suspended load is several times greater than the bed load transport. Values commonly fall within the bounds 85{\textendash}99\% suspended load to 1{\textendash}15\% bed load. The precise proportion depends on the transport power of the river, the hydrological regime, the geological structure of the catchment and human activity.

This contribution aims to explore further the relationship between suspended load and bed load transport, to highlight the great divergence evident in the proportions of the total load accounted for by the two load components, and to explain the source of this divergence. The study is based on available literature documenting fluvial transport and incorporates the results of measurements undertaken in the lower Vistula River in Poland.},

The so-called impulse counts derived from the geophone signal are converted into bedload fluxes. The bedload transport measuring installation is located a few hundred meters upstream of a runoff gauging station in the village of Tiefencastel. The most important bedload transporting flows generally occur during the snowmelt period with additional runoff generation due to rainfall events. We present and discuss the variability of bedload transport during the summer periods from 2015 to 2018. We also compare the annual bedload masses in the Albula river with measurements made with the SPG system in mountain rivers in Austria. Furthermore, we show how well averaged values of measured bedload transport can be predicted with bedload transport equations which were not calibrated with the measurements at the Albula River.},

For example, plants form associations with neighboring plants, microflora, and microfauna, while humans maintain symbiotic associations with intestinal microbial flora, which is indispensable for nutrient assimilation and development of the innate immune system. Most of these associations are facilitated by chemical cues exchanged between the host and the symbionts. In the rhizosphere, which includes plant roots and the surrounding area of soil influenced by the roots, plants exude chemicals to effectively communicate with their neighboring soil organisms. Here we review the current literature pertaining to the chemical communication that exists between plants and microorganisms and the biological processes they sustain.}

The catchment is 255 ha in area and has experienced extensive soil erosion and losses of nutrients from intensive vegetable cultivation, irrigated dairy pasture and poultry farms. Simulations of nitrogen and phosphorus loads in the Currency Creek catchment were performed at various temporal scales and the degree of calibration was quantified by comparing the simulated data with the monitoring results. In addition, the model independent, nonlinear parameter estimation code PEST, was applied for sensitivity testing to determine and assess the relative importance of the key parameters of the model. Event flows were simulated satisfactorily with AnnAGNPS but only moderate accuracy was achieved for prediction of event-based nitrogen and phosphorus exports. The biggest deviations from the measured data were observed for daily simulations but trends in the generated nutrients matched observed data. Despite achieving good resemblance between measured and predicted phosphorus loads the model showed high level of sensitivity to assigned pH values for topsoil. Increase in pH by one unit resulted in up to 34\% increase in model generated particulate phosphorus load.},

The problem of performance inflation extends beyond back testing. More generally, researchers and investment managers tend to report only positive outcomes, a phenomenon known as selection bias. Not controlling for the number of trials involved in a particular discovery leads to overly optimistic performance expectations. The deflated Sharpe ratio (DSR) corrects for two leading sources of performance inflation: Selection bias under multiple testing and non-normally distributed returns.

To gain experience with hyporheic restoration, an engineered streambed was built using a gravel mixture formulated to mimic natural streambed composition, filling an over-excavated channel to a minimum depth of 90 cm. Specially designed plunge-pool structures, built with subsurface gravel extending down to 2.4 m, promoted greatly enhanced hyporheic circulation, path length, and residence time. Hyporheic process enhancement was verified using intra-gravel temperature mapping to document the distribution and strength of upwelling and downwelling zones, computation of vertical water flux using diurnal streambed temperature patterns, estimation of hyporheic zone cross section using sodium chloride tracer studies, and repeat measurements of streambed sand content to document evolution of the engineered streambed over time. Results showed that vertical water flux in the vicinity of plunge-pool structures was quite large, averaging 89 times the pre-construction rate, and 17 times larger than maximum rates measured in a pristine stream in Idaho. Upwelling and downwelling strengths in the constructed channel were larger and more spatially diverse than in the control. Streambed sand content showed a variety of response over time, indicating that rapid return to an embedded, impermeable state is not occurring.},

The combined effect of climate change and extended irrigation withdrawals will overall lead to reduced runoff in the rivers, according to our simulations. The changes will be most dramatic at Kizilirmak, reducing the water available for hydropower production. The presence of the reservoirs will lead to extended water use/losses due to the provision of regulated flow, enabling larger irrigation withdrawals and increasing the evaporative losses from the reservoir surfaces. Comparing the water consumption losses at Kizilirmak, the irrigation losses are in the range of 2{\textendash}4 times larger than the gross evaporation losses from reservoir surfaces. The reservoirs at Devoll will improve water availability for hydropower production during low flow periods, and the upstream irrigation represents presently a low risk to the downstream power producers. As the results are sensitive to specific river basin characteristics and the assumptions made, the results cannot be generalized to other river basins without taking these specifics into consideration.},

  abstract = {Fragmentation affects river ecosystems worldwide by dampening the movement and dispersal of aquatic organisms and material (such as sediment, water, nutrients) across the river network. In this paper, we develop river connectivity indices to explain biodiversity patterns, prioritize reaches that need habitat restoration and barriers that need improvement. We provide a general framework for calculating connectivity indices by disentangling the contribution of the river network's physical setup (structural connectivity) from the process-driven and biota-related contribution (functional connectivity). To facilitate the calculations, the R package `riverconn' is introduced. A prioritization of habitats and barriers is carried out for the Ebro river (North-West Iberian Peninsula) using indices setups accounting for different classes of organisms and dispersal traits. Resulting prioritizations are very diverse. `Riverconn' can support scientists and managers working on riverscape planning and population and community ecology by providing a means to compute and compare a wide array of fragmentation indices.},

  abstract = {Hydro-geological hazards in alpine areas is a really common problem. Many calamitous phenomena (such as debris flows, landslides, and others) are related to the sediment yield from the slopes of the valleys. Sediment yields are far from being fully understood and predictable, due to a lack of knowledge of the physical mechanisms underlying these processes and to the variability of the peculiar geomorphologic characteristics of river basins. Key unknowns are the medium- and long-term average sediment production, the recharge time of the sediment sources (and consequently the frequency of the yields), the triggering factors and the thresholds for activation. The manuscript documents the results of the estimation of sediment production for the basin of the Tartano valley in northern Italy. The basin is characterized by a significant presence of weak rocks (cataclastic, mylonitic), that makes considerable amounts of loose sediments available. In this work, semi-quantitative models were applied to evaluate the basin-scale, yearly sediment yield. Estimates sediment volumes were compared to records of sediment volumes extracted from an artificial reservoir located at the downstream section of the catchments. In addition, the spatial distribution of the sediment instability level was obtained, highlighting a significant heterogeneity of the river basin. Therefore, the relevance of the basin-scale modelling of sediment yields for off-site and on-site processes was discussed. The dependency of the sediment yield regime on the spatial and temporal scale supporting the evaluations was analyzed and discussed.},

The bed morphology and meander planform adjustment in the study area were simulated over a 10-year period considering a time-varying discharge scenario. The results showed that the 2D model was able to reproduce morphological characteristics such as scour depth, bank erosion and pool-riffle morphology, even though the model showed some deficiencies to reproduce bankfull channel width and transverse bed slopes. Regarding the planimetric evolution, the planform parameters (i.e., meander belt width, meander wavelength and radius of curvature) confirmed that the model results are realistic and are in agreement with results reported in the literature.},

This paper evaluates the impacts of climate change on the water provisioning and erosion control services in the densely populated Mediterranean Llobregat river basin of. The assessment of ecosystem services and their mapping at the basin scale identify the current pressures on the river basin including the source area in the Pyrenees Mountains. Drinking water provisioning is expected to decrease between 3 and 49\%, while total hydropower production will decrease between 5 and 43\%. Erosion control will be reduced by up to 23\%, indicating that costs for dredging the reservoirs as well as for treating drinking water will also increase. Based on these data, the concept for an appropriate quantification and related spatial visualization of ecosystem service is elaborated and discussed.},

Meanwhile, demand for hydropower generation is expected to increase and future hydropower developments will be important for mitigating climate change. Yet, climate change will affect the natural flow regimes, which will undoubtedly impact hydropower operations (e.g., storages and releases), and in turn the impact of altered hydropower operations on the discharge and consequence to fish that live in these regulated systems. Here, we synthesize the current knowledge of climate-induced alterations to hydropower operations and the expected impacts of altered hydropower operations on riverine fishes. We also consider what is needed to adapt to the way environmental threats will change over the typical 50{\textendash}100~year lifespan of such facilities. Based on our synthesis, we anticipate the impact on native riverine fishes will increase in severity moving forward. Fortunately, we can take proactive measures to mitigate the adverse, yet synergistic, impacts of hydropower and climate change on aquatic ecosystems. Doing so will require extensive foresight, planning, and incorporating novel mitigation strategies into hydropower development. We also call for greater involvement of fisheries professionals in such processes to ensure that fish are not an afterthought. Failure to better consider how to future-proof hydropower in the context of climate change threatens not only fish populations but also the humans that depend on them for livelihoods, nutrition, and socio-cultural benefits.},

We improve upon existing literature by estimating the extent of rural populations in 2000 and 2010 globally on degrading and improving agricultural land, taking into account the role of market access, and analyzing the resulting impacts on poverty. Using a variety of spatially referenced datasets, we estimate that 1.33 billion people worldwide in 2000 were located on degrading agricultural land (DAL), of which 1.26 billion were in developing countries. Almost all the world's 200 million people on remote DAL were in developing countries, which is about 6\% of their rural population. There were also 1.54 billion rural people on improving agricultural land (IAL), with 1.34 billion in developing countries. We find that a lower share of people in 2000 on DAL, or a higher share on IAL, lowers significantly how much overall economic growth reduces poverty from 2000 to 2012 across 83 developing countries. As the population on DAL and IAL in developing countries grew by 13\% and 15\% respectively from 2000 to 2010, these changing spatial distributions of rural populations could impact significantly future poverty in developing countries.},

An optimization procedure using the complex method was incorporated to estimate runoff parameters, and ten storms were used for calibration and validation. The calibrated model predicted the observed outputs with reasonable accuracy. A sensitivity analysis showed the impact of the model parameters, and results were most sensitive to imperviousness and impervious depression storage and least sensitive to Manning roughness for surface flow. Optimized imperviousness was greater than imperviousness predicted from land-use information. The results demonstrate that this methodology of integrating GIS and stormwater model with a constrained optimization technique can be applied to large watersheds.},

  abstract = {The estimation of hydrological model parameters is a challenging task. With increasing capacity of computational power several complex optimization algorithms have emerged, but none of the algorithms gives a unique and very best parameter vector. The parameters of fitted hydrological models depend upon the input data. The quality of input data cannot be assured as there may be measurement errors for both input and state variables. In this study a methodology has been developed to find a set of robust parameter vectors for a hydrological model. To see the effect of observational error on parameters, stochastically generated synthetic measurement errors were applied to observed discharge and temperature data. With this modified data, the model was calibrated and the effect of measurement errors on parameters was analysed. It was found that the measurement errors have a significant effect on the best performing parameter vector. The erroneous data led to very different optimal parameter vectors. To overcome this problem and to find a set of robust parameter vectors, a geometrical approach based on Tukey's half space depth was used. The depth of the set of N randomly generated parameters was calculated with respect to the set with the best model performance (Nash-Sutclife efficiency was used for this study) for each parameter vector. Based on the depth of parameter vectors, one can find a set of robust parameter vectors. The results show that the parameters chosen according to the above criteria have low sensitivity and perform well when transfered to a different time period. The method is demonstrated on the upper Neckar catchment in Germany. The conceptual HBV model was used for this study.},

The most common methods to regulate the velocity are the inertia weight and constriction factor. Here, we present a different method to regulate the velocity by changing the maximum limit of the velocity at each iteration, thus eliminating the use of a factor. We go further and present a simpler version of the PSO algorithm that achieves competitive and, in some cases, even better results than the original PSO algorithm.},

We compare results from dynamic modelling of nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea under projections of climate change and scenarios for shared socioeconomic pathways. Average nutrient loads are projected to increase by 8\% and 14\% for nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, in response to climate change scenarios. In contrast, changes in the socioeconomic drivers can lead to a decrease of 13\% and 6\% or an increase of 11\% and 9\% in nitrogen and phosphorus loads, respectively, depending on the pathway. This indicates that policy decisions still play a major role in climate adaptation and in managing eutrophication in the Baltic Sea region.},

One such tool is a dynamic process-based rainfall-runoff and water quality model called Hydrological Predictions for Environment (HYPE). This study presents and compares historical simulations of runoff and sediment concentrations for three nested-model domains using global, continental (Europe), and national (Sweden) catchment-based HYPE applications. Future impacts on runoff, soil moisture, and aridity from changing climate were assessed using the global and continental HYPE applications with three coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models (GCMs). Simulated sediment concentrations varied considerably among the nested models in spatial patterns due to different data sources, whereas runoff values were more similar. Regardless of the variation, the global model was able to provide information on climate change impacts comparable to those from the continental and national models for hydrological indicators. Global hydrological models are thus valuable tools for, e.g.,~first screenings of climate change effects and detection of spatial patterns. Comparison across nested domains demonstrates the significance of scale that needs to be considered when interpreting the impacts alongside with model performance.},

  abstract = {For many practical optimization problems, the evaluation of a solution is subject to noise, and optimization heuristics capable of handling such noise are needed. In this paper, we examine the influence of noise on particle swarm optimization and demonstrate that the resulting stagnation can not be removed by parameter optimization alone, but requires a reduction of noise through averaging over multiple samples. In order to reduce the number of required samples, we propose a combination of particle swarm optimization and a statistical sequential selection procedure, called optimal computing budget allocation, which attempts to distribute a given number of samples in the most effective way. Experimental results show that this new algorithm indeed outperforms the other alternatives.},

Two experiments (100 and 140 l s 1) in a 1{\DH}95 m wide straight channel showed deposition concentrated in a berm along the channel bank. Little sediment was transferred further onto the floodplain. For the larger flow, the berm formed further from the channel. A single experiment (103 l s 1) with a 1{\DH}31 m wide meandering channel showed deposition across the entire floodplain tongue between successive meanders. Maximum deposition occurred on the downstream side of the meander, just past the bend apex. These generalized flume results complement the real-world but site-specific data of field studies.

Our current understanding of the role of rivers in the global carbon cycle remains limited, which makes it difficult to predict how global change may alter the timing and spatial distribution of riverine carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. Here we review the state of river ecosystem metabolism research and synthesize the current best available estimates of river ecosystem metabolism. We quantify the organic and inorganic carbon flux from land to global rivers and show that their net ecosystem production and carbon dioxide emissions shift the organic to inorganic carbon balance en route from land to the coastal ocean. Furthermore, we discuss how global change may affect river ecosystem metabolism and related carbon fluxes and identify research directions that can help to~develop better predictions of the effects of~global~change on riverine ecosystem processes. We argue that a global river observing system will play a key role in understanding river networks and their future evolution in the context of the global carbon budget.},

We propose a new variational approach which allows robust and accurate solution on relatively coarse Cartesian grids, allowing possibly orders of magnitude faster simulation. By rephrasing the classical pressure projection step as a kinetic energy minimization, broadly similar to modern approaches to rigid body contact, we permit a robust coupling between fluid and arbitrary solid simulations that always gives a well-posed symmetric positive semi-definite linear system. We provide several examples of efficient fluid-solid interaction and rigid body coupling with sub-grid cell flow. In addition, we extend the framework with a new boundary condition for free-surface flow, allowing fluid to separate naturally from solids.},

  abstract = {Floating photovoltaics (FPV) is emerging as a promising renewable energy technology which enables the production of electricity on surface waters. While this technology could potentially make an important contribution to the energy transition, the current uncertainty about the water quality effects of FPV deployment poses a major barrier to FPV project development and implementation. In this study, we investigated the water quality effects of three distinctive FPV system designs, implemented as part of a 1-year pilot project at the Oostvoornse lake, the Netherlands. A water quality monitoring campaign was set up to monitor on a continuous basis a set of key water quality parameters, including light intensity, water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration. The measurements were conducted below each of the three FPV systems and contrasted with reference measurements at open water adjacent to the systems. Our monitoring results show that of the water quality parameters considered, the impact of the FPV systems on light intensity was found to be most pronounced, with a light reduction between 73\% and 100\% relative to the reference measurements. We found limited evidence to corroborate that the FPV systems induced changes to the water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration. However, it must be noted that this study took place under highly specific conditions due the limited size of the FPV pilot systems and the brackish water of the Oostvoornse lake. This means that the water quality effects reported here may not be representative for a larger scale application of the FPV designs, and may not be one-on-one transferable to other, non-brackish project locations elsewhere.},

The result is a closed-form expression similar to BIC, but now involves a term arising from the prior distribution (which BIC ignores) and also incorporates the idea that different parameters can have different effective sample sizes (whereas BIC only allows one overall sample size n). We also consider a modification of PBIC which is more favourable to complex models.},

  abstract = {Several mathematical models for analyzing reservoir temperature stratification have recently been developed. In general, these involve examination of hourly temperature changes. Their use in practical applications is limited because of the large amounts of observational data required. There is an increasing use of reservoir storage for bridging drought periods of several years which requires examination of many combinations of reservoir storage levels and seasonal inflow patterns. Consequently, it is not possible to select a few representative years for analysis, and ordinarily 30 or more years of data are required. It is practical to do this only if a long computation interval, such as one month, can be used. Much of the observational data needed in existing models is ordinarily not available. A practical model must use generalized data such as average air temperature and average radiation. A generalized model must be capable of making releases through specific outlets or automatically selecting the outlets that will maintain outflow temperatures within a desired range as long as possible and leave the temperature of the remaining stored water at an optimum value. A computer program has been developed that conforms to the above requirements and automatically calibrates the model.},

For both time periods we calculate confidence levels from the ensemble spread, providing valuable indications of the reliability of the classifications.

  abstract = {This study presents an experimental approach to investigate cohesive reservoir sediments. It is shown, how adjacent sediment cores can be extracted from reservoir beds with a Frahm Sediment Sampler. The cores are subsequently used for detailed investigations in a hydraulic laboratory. In a first step, related cores are identified based on their bulk density profiles. One part of the related cores is used to analyze the sediment properties over depth by means of potential stability parameters. The other part is used to determine the depth-dependent erosion stability in an erosion flume (SETEG-system). In the SETEG-system, a photogrammetric method is applied to measure the erosion rates of predefined sediment layers at different exposed shear stresses. Subsequently, the critical shear stress can be derived, which leads to an objective evaluation and allows a systematic approach. Finally, both results are combined to investigate possible correlations between the evaluated depthdependent stability parameters and the measured erosion stability. The approach is presented on sediment cores from the case study ``Kleiner Brombachsee'', a reservoir that is located in Middle Franconia, Germany.},

  abstract = {This study suggests a stochastic Bayesian approach for calibrating and validating morphodynamic sediment transport models and for quantifying parametric uncertainties in order to alleviate limitations of conventional (manual, deterministic) calibration procedures. The applicability of our method is shown for a large-scale (11.0 km) and time-demanding (9.14 hr for the period 2002{\textendash}2013) 2-D morphodynamic sediment transport model of the Lower River Salzach and for three most sensitive input parameters (critical Shields parameter, grain roughness, and grain size distribution). Since Bayesian methods require a significant number of simulation runs, this work proposes to construct a surrogate model, here with the arbitrary polynomial chaos technique. The surrogate model is constructed from a limited set of runs (n = 20) of the full complex sediment transport model. Then, Monte Carlo-based techniques for Bayesian calibration are used with the surrogate model (105 realizations in 4 hr). The results demonstrate that following Bayesian principles and iterative Bayesian updating of the surrogate model (10 iterations) enables to identify the most probable ranges of the three calibration parameters. Model verification based on the maximum a posteriori parameter combination indicates that the surrogate model accurately replicates the morphodynamic behavior of the sediment transport model for both calibration (RMSE = 0.31 m) and validation (RMSE = 0.42 m). Furthermore, it is shown that the surrogate model is highly effective in lowering the total computational time for Bayesian calibration, validation, and uncertainty analysis. As a whole, this provides more realistic calibration and validation of morphodynamic sediment transport models with quantified uncertainty in less time compared to conventional calibration procedures.},

Large dams in the Zambezi catchment have substantially altered the magnitude, timing, duration, and frequency of flooding events in the delta, resulting in adverse ecological and socio-economic changes. We evaluated conflicts/trade-offs among various water uses and the potential for improving delta conditions through environmental flow releases from Cahora Bassa Dam, using the downstream response to imposed flow transformations (Brown, C.A. and Joubert, A., 2003.

Rivers Research and Applications, 19 (5{\textendash}6), 619{\textendash}640) model. Five variations in low flows, 18 alternatives for annual floods, and one extreme (1:5 year) flood were considered for a range of uses/concerns, including commercial and small-scale agriculture, estuarine ecology, coastal and freshwater fisheries, livestock, large mammals, waterbirds, vegetation, invasive species, natural resources, water quality, navigation, and groundwater recharge. The study revealed minimal trade-offs among different uses with regard to reinstating environmental flows. The majority of user-representatives perceive reinstatement of the annual flood to be beneficial and the perceived benefits increase with increased magnitude and prolonged duration, provided the timing of the annual flood occurs during the normal wet season. Simulation modelling of the Zambezi system dam operation indicates that these environmental flow releases can be realized within the constraints of firm power commitments and total energy demand. Of the 18 annual flood change levels considered, 7 can be generated with a firm power reliability {$>$}95\% and hydropower reductions of {$<$}2.3\%, and 16 require {$<$}10\% reduction in annual energy production. This work illustrates the potential for environmental flows to overcome conflict in shared water resources and create opportunities for cooperation.},

Unlike lumped models, distributed models involve large number of calibration parameters, representing the spatial heterogeneity of inputs and various physical processes within a watershed. An automatic calibration routine is developed using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) that has been proved to be an effective and efficient multiobjective search technique in various applications. The automatic routine is capable of incorporating multiple objectives into the calibration process and also employs parameterization to help reduce the number of calibration parameters. In this study, SWAT is calibrated for daily streamflow and sediment concentration. Two calibration scenarios have been considered; the first scenario uses specific objective functions to fit different portions of the time series whereas in the second scenario, the calibration is performed using data from multiple gauging stations, simultaneously. In addition, two cases of parameter distribution have been considered in the second scenario during parameterization. The application results show that the approach is consistent and effective in estimating parameters of the model. The use of multiple objectives during the calibration process resulted in improved model performance and the second scenario, in particular, provided better results partly due to the respective location of the gauging stations within the watershed. Further distribution of parameters during parameterization also resulted in better sediment simulation.},

These methods are powerful because they can rapidly and automatically extract rich contextual and spatial information from images, a process that has historically required a large amount of human labor. A wide range of recent scientific applications have demonstrated the potential of these methods to change how researchers study the ocean. However, despite their promise, machine learning tools are still under-exploited in many domains including species and environmental monitoring, biodiversity surveys, fisheries abundance and size estimation, rare event and species detection, the study of animal behavior, and citizen science. Our objective in this article is to provide an approachable, end-to-end guide to help researchers apply image-based machine learning methods effectively to their own research problems. Using a case study, we describe how to prepare data, train and deploy models, and overcome common issues that can cause models to underperform. Importantly, we discuss how to diagnose problems that can cause poor model performance on new imagery to build robust tools that can vastly accelerate data acquisition in the marine realm.

  abstract = {Geomorphic units are the elementary spatial physical features of the river mosaic at the reach scale that are nested within the overall hydromorphological structure of a river and its catchment. Geomorphic units also constitute the template of physical habitats for the biota. The assessment of river hydromorphological conditions is required by the European Water Framework Directive 2000/60 (WFD) for the classification and monitoring of water bodies and is useful for establishing links between their physical and biological conditions. The spatial scale of geomorphic units, incorporating their component elements and hydraulic patches, is the most appropriate to assess these links. Given the weakness of existing methods for the characterisation and assessment of geomorphic units and physical habitats (e.g., lack of a well-defined spatiotemporal framework, terminology issues, etc.), a new system for the survey and characterisation of river geomorphic units is needed that fits within a geomorphologically meaningful framework. This paper presents a system for the survey and classification of geomorphic units (GUS, geomorphic units survey and classification system) aimed at characterising physical habitats and stream morphology. The method is embedded into a multiscale, hierarchical framework for the analysis of river hydromorphological conditions. Three scales of geomorphic units are considered (i.e., macro-units, units, sub-units), organised within two spatial domains (i.e., bankfull channel and floodplain). Different levels of characterisation can be applied, depending on the aims of the survey: broad, basic, and detailed level. At each level, different, complementary information is collected. The method is applied by combining remote sensing analysis and field survey, according to the spatial scale and the level of description required. The method is applicable to most of fluvial conditions, and has been designed to be flexible and adaptable according to the objectives (e.g., reach characterisation, assessment, monitoring) and available data (e.g., image resolution). The method supports integrated hydromorphological assessment at the reach scale (e.g., the Morphological Quality Index, MQI) and therefore contributes to better establishing links between hydromorphological conditions at the reach scale, characteristic geomorphic units, and related biological conditions.},

Rare groups on the OMZ margin are abundant at lower dissolved oxygen concentrations, including sulphur-cycling Chromatiales, for which 16S rRNA was amplified from extracted RNA. Microbial species distribution models accurately replicate community patterns based on multivariate environmental data, demonstrate likely changes in distributions and diversity in the eastern tropical North Pacific Ocean, and highlight the sensitivity of key bacterial groups to deoxygenation. Through these mechanisms, OMZ expansion may alter microbial composition, competition, diversity and function, all of which have implications for biogeochemical cycling in OMZs.},

  abstract = {In this article, we present a novel method for the robust handling of static and dynamic rigid boundaries in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. We build upon the ideas of the density maps approach which has been introduced recently by Koschier and Bender. They precompute the density contributions of solid boundaries and store them on a spatial grid which can be efficiently queried during runtime. This alleviates the problems of commonly used boundary particles, like bumpy surfaces and inaccurate pressure forces near boundaries. Our method is based on a similar concept but we precompute the volume contribution of the boundary geometry. This maintains all benefits of density maps but offers a variety of advantages which are demonstrated in several experiments. First, in contrast to the density maps method we can compute derivatives in the standard SPH manner by differentiating the kernel function. This results in smooth pressure forces, even for lower map resolutions, such that precomputation times and memory requirements are reduced by more than two orders of magnitude compared to density maps. Furthermore, this directly fits into the SPH concept so that volume maps can be seamlessly combined with existing SPH methods. Finally, the kernel function is not baked into the map such that the same volume map can be used with different kernels. This is especially useful when we want to incorporate common surface tension or viscosity methods that use different kernels than the fluid simulation.}

In order to be able to draw statistically convincing conclusions, it is important to estimate the uncertainty of such estimates. This paper studies the very commonly used K-fold cross-validation estimator of generalization performance. The main theorem shows that there exists no universal (valid under all distributions) unbiased estimator of the variance of K-fold cross-validation. The analysis that accompanies this result is based on the eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of errors, which has only three different eigenvalues corresponding to three degrees of freedom of the matrix and three components of the total variance. This analysis helps to better understand the nature of the problem and how it can make naive estimators (that don't take into account the error correlations due to the overlap between training and test sets) grossly underestimate variance. This is confirmed by numerical experiments in which the three components of the variance are compared when the difficulty of the learning problem and the number of folds are varied. {\textcopyright} 2004 Yoshua Bengio and Yves Grandvalet.},

  abstract = {Berkeley Electronic Press Selected Works, Annual total suspended solid (TSS) loads in the Mae Sa River in northern Thailand, determined with an automated, turbidity-based monitoring approach, were approximately 62,000, 33,000, and 14,000 Mg during the three years of observation. These loads were equivalent to basin yields of 839 (603-1170), 445 (217-462), and 192 (108-222) Mg km-2 for the 74.16-km2 catchment during 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. The yearly uncertainty ranges indicate our loads may be underestimated by 38-43\% or overestimated by 28-33\%. In determining the annual loads, discharge (Q) and turbidity (T) values were compared against 333 hand-sampled total suspended solid concentrations (TSS) measured during 18 runoff events and other flow conditions across the three-year period. Annual rainfall varied from 1632 to 1934 mm; and catchment runoff coefficients (annual runoff/annual rainfall) ranged from 0.25 to 0.41. Measured TSS ranged from 8-15,900 mg l-1; the low value was associated with dry-season base flow; the latter, a wet-season storm. Storm size and location played an important role in producing clockwise, anticlockwise, and complex hysteresis effects in the Q-TSS relationship. Turbidity alone was a good estimator for turbidity ranges of roughly 10-2800 NTU (or concentrations approximately 25-4000 mg l-1). However, owing to hysteresis and high sediment concentrations that surpass the detection limits of the turbidity sensor during many annual storms, TSS was estimated best using a complex multiple regression equation based on high/low ranges of turbidity and Q as independent variables. Turbidity was not a good predictor of TSS fractions {$>$} 2000 {$\mu$}m. Hysteresis in the monthly Q-TSS relationship was generally clockwise over the course of the monsoon season, but infrequent large dry-season storms disrupted the pattern in some years. The large decrease in annual loads during the study was believed to be related to depletion of fine sediment delivered to the stream by several landslides occurring the year prior to the study. The study indicated the importance of monitoring Q and turbidity at fine resolutions (e.g., sub-hourly) to capture the TSS dynamics and to make accurate load estimations in this flashy headwater stream where hysteresis in the Q-TSS signature varied at several time scales.}

  abstract = {Abstract. HydroGFD (Hydrological Global Forcing Data) is a data set of bias adjusted reanalysis data for daily precipitation, and minimum, mean, and maximum temperature. It is mainly intended for large scale hydrological modeling, but is also suitable for other impact modeling. The data set has an almost global land area coverage, excluding the Antarctic continent, at a horizontal resolution of 0.25{\textdegree}, i.e. about 25\,km. It is available for the complete ERA5 reanalysis time period; currently 1979 until five days ago. This period will be extended back to 1950 once the back catalogue of ERA5 is available. The historical period is adjusted using global gridded observational data sets, and to acquire real-time data, a collection of several reference data sets is used. Consistency in time is attempted by relying on a background climatology, and only making use of anomalies from the different data sets. Precipitation is adjusted for mean bias as well as the number or wet days in a month. The latter is relying on a calibrated statistical method with input only of the monthly precipitation anomaly, such that no additional input data about the number of wet days is necessary. The daily mean temperature is adjusted toward the monthly mean of the observations, and applied to 1\,h timesteps of the ERA5 reanalysis. Daily mean, minimum and maximum temperature are then calculated. The performance of the HydroGFD3 data set is on par with other similar products, although there are significant differences in different parts of the globe, especially where observations are uncertain. Further, HydroGFD3 tends to have higher precipitation extremes, partly due to its higher spatial resolution. In this paper, we present the methodology, evaluation results, and how to access to the data set at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3871707.},

  abstract = {Bias adjustment is the practice of statistically transforming climate model data in order to reduce systematic deviations from a reference data set, typically some sort of observations. There are numerous proposed methodologies to perform the adjustments {\textendash} ranging from simple scaling approaches to advanced multi-variate distribution-based mapping. In practice, the actual bias adjustment method is a small step in the application, and most of the processing handles reading, writing, and linking different data sets. These practical processing steps become especially heavy with increasing model domain size and resolution in both time and space. Here, we present a new implementation platform for bias adjustment, which we call MIdAS (MultI-scale bias AdjuStment). MIdAS is a modern code implementation that supports features such as modern Python libraries that allow efficient processing of large data sets at computing clusters, state-of-the-art bias adjustment methods based on quantile mapping, and ``day-of-year-based'' adjustments to avoid artificial discontinuities, and it also introduces cascade adjustment in time and space. The MIdAS platform has been set up such that it will continually support development of methods aimed towards higher-resolution climate model data, explicitly targeting cases where there is a scale mismatch between data sets. The paper presents a comparison of different quantile-mapping-based bias adjustment methods and the subsequently chosen code implementation for MIdAS. A current recommended setup of the MIdAS bias adjustment is presented and evaluated in a pseudo-reference setup for regions around the world. Special focus is put on preservation of trends in future climate projections, and it is shown that the cascade adjustments perform better than the standard quantile mapping implementations and are often similar to methods that explicitly preserve trends.},

  abstract = {Hydropower is a clean, renewable, and environmentally friendly source of energy. It produces 3930 (TW.h).a-1, and yields 16\% of the world's generated electricity and about 78\% of renewable electricity generation (in 2015). Hydropower and climate change show a double relationship. On the one hand, as an important renewable energy resource, hydropower contributes significantly to the avoidance of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to the mitigation of global warming. On the other hand, climate change is likely to alter river discharge, impacting water availability and hydropower generation. Hydropower contributes significantly to the reduction of GHG emissions and to energy supply security. Compared with conventional coal power plants, hydropower prevents the emission of about 3 GT CO2 per year, which represents about 9\% of global annual CO2 emissions. Hydropower projects may also have an enabling role beyond the electricity sector, as a financing instrument for multipurpose reservoirs and as an adaptive measure regarding the impacts of climate change on water resources, because regulated basins with large reservoir capacities are more resilient to water resource changes, less vulnerable to climate change, and act as a storage buffer against climate change. At the global level, the overall impact of climate change on existing hydropower generation may be expected to be small, or even slightly positive. However, there is the possibility of substantial variations across regions and even within countries. In conclusion, the general verdict on hydropower is that it is a cheap and mature technology that contributes significantly to climate change mitigation, and could play an important role in the climate change adaptation of water resource availability. However, careful attention is necessary to mitigate the substantial environmental and social costs. Roughly more than a terawatt of capacity could be added in upcoming decades.},

Within the riffle communities the abundance of fish of two feeding guilds {\textemdash} benthic insectivores and herbivores {\textemdash} was reduced as the percent of fine substrate increased. The abundance of fish in other feeding guilds was not affected. The only reproductive guild to be similarly affected was the simple and lithophilous, whose members require a clean gravel substrate for spawning. Species within each guild affected by siltation had significantly similar trends in abundance. The guild analysis indicated that species with similar ecological requirements had a common response to habitat degradation by siltation.},

  abstract = {Pumped-storage hydroelectric power plants are generally perceived as an environmentally respectful technology. Nevertheless, the pumping of water from a lower reservoir to an upper impoundment, and the return of that water during power generation, can strongly affect the water quality of the reservoirs. In particular, plant operation can alter their thermal structure, deep water mixing, and water circulation characteristics. The objective of this study is to quantify, through the use of 3D hydrodynamic modeling, the potential impacts of a pumped-storage hydroelectric plant on the thermal stability and mixing of two reservoirs in Galicia, northwest of Spain. To this end, three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations were conducted using the model Delft3D. Two different coupled models, one for each reservoir, were constructed and subsequently tested for several stratification scenarios, according to measured temperature profiles during the spring and summer season. Several reservoir minimum and maximum operation water levels were also considered. Model simulations demonstrated a high level of mixing in the vicinity of the intake-outlet structures, in particular during startup of the power plant, regardless of the water level in the reservoir. Beyond this area, the results showed a limited overall effect on stratification and mixing in the upper reservoir, owing to the relation between the inflow temperatures and the initial temperature profile of this reservoir. A more significant alteration of the thermal structure is expected in the lower reservoir due to its narrow shape and shallow depth at the structure location, as well as the temperature differences between receiving waters and inflow.},

Conventional depth-averaging does not account for the curvature-induced second- ary flow that gives rise to the migration. To remedy this deficiency, a secondary flow correction SFC has been developed and incorporated in the two- dimensional STREMR code. The secondary governing equation contains two-empirical coefficients, and these have been adjusted to make STREMR predictions agree with observed velocity profiles for a single 270-deg bend. Without further adjustment, the SFC yields comparable accuracy for multiple-bend predictions in two other channels with depth, curvature, and bottom friction different from the 270-deg case. This suggests that the SFC may be useful in general for bendways with small curvature, gentle side slope, and moderate bottom friction.},

  abstract = {Microbial biofilms assemble from cells that attach to a surface, where they develop into matrix-enclosed communities. Mechanistic insights into community assembly are crucial to better understand the functioning of natural biofilms, which drive key ecosystem processes in numerous aquatic habitats. We studied the role of the suspended microbial community as the source of the biofilm community in three streams using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism and 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the 16S rRNA gene (as a measure for the active and the bulk community, respectively). Diversity was consistently lower in the biofilm communities than in the suspended stream water communities. We propose that the higher diversity in the suspended communities is supported by continuous inflow from various sources within the catchment. Community composition clearly differed between biofilms and suspended communities, whereas biofilm communities were similar in all three streams. This suggests that biofilm assembly did not simply reflect differences in the source communities, but that certain microbial groups from the source community proliferate in the biofilm. We compared the biofilm communities with random samples of the respective community suspended in the stream water. This analysis confirmed that stochastic dispersal from the source community was unlikely to shape the observed community composition of the biofilms, in support of species sorting as a major biofilm assembly mechanism. Bulk and active populations generated comparable patterns of community composition in the biofilms and the suspended communities, which suggests similar assembly controls on these populations.},

  abstract = {It may be endemic to mechanistic modelling of complex environmental systems that there are many different model structures and many different parameter sets within a chosen model structure that may be behavioural or acceptable in reproducing the observed behaviour of that system. This has been called the equi{\textregistered}nality concept. The generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for model identi{\textregistered}cation allowing for equi{\textregistered}nality is described. Prediction within this methodology is a process of ensemble forecasting using a sample of parameter sets from the behavioural model space, with each sample weighted according to its likelihood measure to estimate prediction quantiles. This allows that different models may contribute to the ensemble prediction interval at different time steps and that the distributional form of the predictions may change over time. Any effects of model nonlinearity, covariation of parameter values and errors in model structure, input data or observed variables, with which the simulations are compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure. GLUE involves a number of choices that must be made explicit and can be therefore subjected to scrutiny and discussion. These include ways of combining information from different types of model evaluation or from different periods in a data assimilation context. An example application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to illustrate the methodology, including the updating of likelihood measures. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the use of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology in the 20 years since the paper by Beven and Binley in Hydrological Processes in (1992), which is now one of the most highly cited papers in hydrology. The original conception, the on-going controversy it has generated, the nature of different sources of uncertainty and the meaning of the GLUE prediction uncertainty bounds are discussed. The hydrological, rather than statistical, arguments about the nature of model and data errors and uncertainties that are the basis for GLUE are emphasized. The application of the Institute of Hydrology distributed model to the Gwy catchment at Plynlimon presented in the original paper is revisited, using a larger sample of models, a wider range of likelihood evaluations and new visualization techniques. It is concluded that there are good reasons to reject this model for that data set. This is a positive result in a research environment in that it requires improved models or data to be made available. In practice, there may be ethical issues of using outputs from models for which there is evidence for model rejection in decision making. Finally, some suggestions for what is needed in the next 20 years are provided. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors. Hydrological Processes published by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Although soil erosion has been recognized worldwide as a threat to the sustainability of natural ecosystems, its quantification presents one of the greatest challenges in natural resources and environmental planning. Precise modelling of soil erosion and sediment yield is particularly difficult, as soil erosion is a highly dynamic process at the spatial scale. The main objective of this study was to simulate soil erosion and sediment yield using two fundamentally different approaches: empirical and process-oriented. The revised form of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), along with a sediment delivery distributed model (SEDD) and the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE), which are popular empirical models, were applied in a sub-basin of the Mun River basin, Thailand. The results obtained from the RUSLE/SEDD and MUSLE models were compared with those obtained from a process-oriented soil erosion and sediment transport model. The latter method involves spatial disaggregation of the catchment into homogeneous grid cells to capture the catchment heterogeneity. A GIS technique was used for the spatial discretization of the catchment and to derive the physical parameters related to erosion in the grid cells. The simulated outcomes from the process-oriented model were found to be closer to observations as compared to the outcomes of the empirical approaches.},

Laboratory experiments were conducted in a large-scale mobile-bed channel with graded materials under bank-full and overbank flow conditions. Bed-load samples were collected with a calibrated minisampler. Vanes, constructed against the outer bank in a meander bend, relocated the scour hole toward midchannel, thereby protecting the bank from erosion. The sediment sizes ͑d50, d90͒ in the bend became slightly more coarse and more uniform in the center of the channel. The W-weir installed immediately below a riffle section created two scour holes without affecting the upstream bed or the natural sediment transport of the channel. Predictions of bed-load transport by selected deterministic and stochastic methods showed large deviation from measurements using Helley{\textendash}Smith sampler in sections downstream of the bend apex. In addition to creating local scour holes, the structures also relocated the locus of sediment transport at downstream sections. This issue should be considered when installing vanes and weirs in meandering rivers with significant bed-load transport.},

Existing technology allows in situ automated measurements of water quality constituents, including both solutes and particulates, at unprecedented frequencies from seconds to subdaily sampling intervals. This detailed chemical information can be combined with measurements of hydrological and biogeochemical processes, bringing new insights into the sources, transport pathways, and transformation processes of solutes and particulates in complex catchments and along the aquatic continuum. Here, we summarize established and emerging high-frequency water quality technologies, outline key high-frequency hydrochemical data sets, and review scientific advances in key focus areas enabled by the rapid development of high-frequency water quality measurements in streams and rivers. Finally, we discuss future directions and challenges for using high-frequency water quality measurements to bridge scientific and management gaps by promoting a holistic understanding of freshwater systems and catchment status, health, and function.}

This is due to the sheer number of possible decision alternatives over the lifetime of the structure and the uncertainty surrounding the deterioration processes, the structural performance and the outcomes of inspection and maintenance actions. To address this challenge, Luque and Straub (2019) proposed a heuristic approach in which I\&M plans for structural systems are defined through a set of simple decision rules. Here, we formalize the optimization of these decision rules and extend the approach to enable adaptive planning. The initially optimal I\&M plan is successively adapted throughout the service life, based on past inspection and monitoring results. The proposed methodology uses stochastic deterioration models and accounts for the interdependence among structural components. The heuristic-based adaptive planning is illustrated for a structural frame subjected to fatigue.},

  abstract = {The increasing volume of research submissions to academic journals poses a significant challenge for traditional peer-review processes. To address this issue, this study explores the potential of employing ChatGPT, an advanced large language model (LLM), developed by OpenAI, as an artificial intelligence (AI) reviewer for academic journals. By leveraging the vast knowledge and natural language processing capabilities of ChatGPT, we hypothesize it may be possible to enhance the efficiency, consistency, and quality of the peer-review process. This research investigated key aspects of integrating ChatGPT into the journal review workflow. We compared the critical analysis of ChatGPT, acting as an AI reviewer, to human reviews for a single published article. Our methodological framework involved subjecting ChatGPT to an intricate examination, wherein its evaluative acumen was juxtaposed against human-authored reviews of a singular published article. As this is a feasibility study, one article was reviewed, which was a case report on scurvy. The entire article was used as an input into ChatGPT and commanded it to ``Please perform a review of the following article and give points for revision.'' Since this was a case report with a limited word count the entire article could fit in one chat box. The output by ChatGPT was then compared with the comments by human reviewers. Key performance metrics, including precision and overall agreement, were judiciously and subjectively measured to portray the efficacy of ChatGPT as an AI reviewer in comparison to its human counterparts. The outcomes of this rigorous analysis unveiled compelling evidence regarding ChatGPT's performance as an AI reviewer. We demonstrated that ChatGPT's critical analyses aligned with those of human reviewers, as evidenced by the inter-rater agreement. Notably, ChatGPT exhibited commendable capability in identifying methodological flaws, articulating insightful feedback on theoretical frameworks, and gauging the overall contribution of the articles to their respective fields. While the integration of ChatGPT showcased immense promise, certain challenges and caveats surfaced. For example, ambiguities might present with complex research articles, leading to nuanced discrepancies between AI and human reviews. Also figures and images cannot be reviewed by ChatGPT. Lengthy articles need to be reviewed in parts by ChatGPT as the entire article will not fit in one chat/response. The benefits consist of reduction in time needed by journals to review the articles submitted to them, as well as an AI assistant to give a different perspective about the research papers other than the human reviewers. In conclusion, this research contributes a groundbreaking foundation for incorporating ChatGPT into the pantheon of journal reviewers. The delineated guidelines distill key insights into operationalizing ChatGPT as a proficient reviewer within academic journal frameworks, paving the way for a more efficient and insightful review process.},

The accuracy reached by these technologies recently has started to satisfy the spatial and spectral resolutions required to properly analyse the hydromorphological character of river systems at multiple scales. Using the River Hierarchical Framework (RHF) as a reference we describe the state-of-the-art RS technologies that can be implemented to quantify hydromorphological characteristics at each of the spatial scales incorporated in the RHF (i.e. catchment, landscape unit, river segment, river reach, sub-reach{\textemdash}geomorphic and hydraulic units). We also report the results of a survey on RS data availability in EU member states that shows the current potential to derive RHF hydromorphological indicators from high-resolution multispectral images and topographic LiDAR at the national scale across Europe. This paper shows that many of the assessment indicators proposed by the RHF can be derived by different RS sources and existing methodologies, and that EU countries have sufficient RS data at present to already begin their incorporation into hydromorphological assessment and monitoring, as mandated by WFD. With cooperation and planning, RS data can form a fundamental component of hydromorphological assessment and monitoring in the future to help support the effective and sustainable management of rivers, and this would be done most effectively through the establishment of multi-purpose RS acquisition campaigns and the development of shared and standardized hydromorphological RS databases updated regularly through planned resurveyed campaigns.},

  abstract = {The TOUGH2 family of codes is used extensively around the world to model geothermal reservoirs. The efficacy of the TOUGH2 simulator, as a tool for describing system behaviour, relies heavily on the sound choice of the input variables. Increasingly, automated model calibration is used to determine suitable model parameters, with gradient-based inverse methods commonly used as part of the automatic calibration process. These methods currently require multiple time-consuming forward runs of the geothermal simulator (TOUGH2) in order to calculate derivatives of the model response with respect to each model parameter. Progressive refinement and revision of the current inversion methods are required to overcome this computational cost and to accommodate the geothermal industry's need for more sophisticated models with an ever-greater number of model parameters. This paper describes analytical approaches for improving the computational efficiency of the inversion process. We describe the motivation and basic theory of the adjoint and direct simulation methods for calculating derivatives of model outputs with respect to model parameters. Finally, the implementation of the methods is discussed for large-scale geothermal simulators such as TOUGH2.},

This is partly due to difficulty in achieving a good representation of the conceptual models involved. In addition, some early applications of PEST to UK models were based on monitoring data of poor hydrostratigraphic resolution, leading to questionable parameter distributions. The PEST algorithm has been tried and tested worldwide and such former deficiencies can be addressed. This paper presents examples to explain how PEST can be responsibly applied to UK groundwater models to significantly improve model calibration and provide robust sensitivity data while keeping within known bounds of the conceptual model.},

  abstract = {Flow over a developed bottom topography in a bend has been investigated experimentally. The measuring section is in the outer-bank half of the cross section at 60{\cyrchar\CYRNJE} into the bend. Spatial distributions of the mean velocities, turbulent stresses, and mean-flow and turbulent kinetic energy are presented. The cross-sectional motion contains two cells of circulation: besides the classical helical motion (center-region cell), a weaker counterrotating cell (outer-bank cell) is observed in the corner formed by the outer bank and the water surface. The downstream velocity in the outer half-section is higher than the one in straight uniform flow; the core of maximum velocities is found close to the separation between both circulation cells, well below the water surface. The turbulence structure in a bend is different from that in a straight flow, most notably in a reduction of the turbulent activity toward the outer bank. Both the outer-bank cell and reduced turbulent activity have a protective effect on the outer bank and the adjacent bottom and thus influence the stability of the flow perimeter and the bend morphology.},

  abstract = {Coherent flow structures hold the key to a better understanding and modelling of hydrodynamic processes. This paper highlights the unique capabilities of an Acoustic Doppler Velocity Profiler (ADVP) for the experimental investigation of coherent flow structures. Contrary to most commercial velocity meters that measure point-by-point, the ADVP simultaneously measures the quasi-instantaneous velocity vector along an entire profile. This allows to obtain detailed spatial-temporal flow information, and by adopting Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis even to visualize flow planes. Whereas most available data on coherent flow structures were obtained in straight uniform flow, this paper illustrates ADVPmeasurements of two kinds of coherent flow structures in open-channel bends, where the highly three-dimensional flow is characterized by the existence of cross-stream circulation (helical flow). The first kind concerns the turbulent bulk-oscillation of the pattern of crossstream circulation cells, whereas the second concerns turbulent coherent structures associated with the bursting process.},

  abstract = {The sustainable development of rivers requires a knowledge on the three-dimensional mean flow field and the turbulence in complex morphologies. In a future, the computational capacity will be sufficient to simulate numerically the fine details of the flow. Our physical knowledge, however, is at present insufficient: the overwhelming majority of experimental research concerns straight-uniform flow and even complex numerical models are based on straight-uniform-flow knowledge. A sound understanding of the relevant physical processes will always be essential in complicated problems such as the river management, which concern a variety of different fields, and this irrespective of the available computational capacity. This PhD investigates, mainly experimentally, the mean-flow field and the turbulence in open-channel bends; this situation is considered as a generic case for complex highly three-dimensional flow. The experimental investigation is rendered feasible by the availability of a powerful Acoustic Doppler Velocity Profiler (ADVP), developed in our laboratory. The principal objectives of this PhD are: To provide a high-quality data base on three-dimensional open-channel flow, including all three mean velocity components and all six Reynolds stresses on a fine grid. To document interesting features of the flow field and the turbulence, such as the multi-cellular pattern of secondary circulation, the curvature influence on the turbulence, etc. To gain insight in the relevant physical mechanisms and processes underlying these features. To apply the acquired knowledge in an engineering sense, mainly by evaluating, improving and developing numerical simulation techniques. First, a limited series of experiments was conducted in a small laboratory flume, with the aim of testing the feasibility of the project. Subsequently, extended series of experiments have been designed in a large and optimized laboratory flume. The small-flume experiments yielded results beyond all expectations and form the core of this dissertation. The large-flume experiment are intended to confirm those results and to investigate newly emerged questions. Only few large-flume results are included in this dissertation; more large-flume results will be reported in literature in the future. ~ The structure of this dissertation follows the above-mentioned objectives. In PART I "Instrumentation and experimental set-up", the experimental set-up, the ADVP and the measuring strategy are presented. Furthermore, a method is proposed to improve acoustic turbulence measurements. PART II "Experimental observations" provides high-quality data on the mean flow and the turbulence and documents the most interesting features: The downstream velocity increases in outward direction and its vertical profiles are flatter (increased/decreased velocities in the lower/upper part of the flow depth) than in straight flow. A relatively small and weak outer-bank cell of secondary circulation exists besides the classical center-region cell (helical motion). The turbulence activity is reduced in the outer half of the cross-section in the investigated bend, as compared to a straight-uniform flow. Linear models that are commonly used to account for the effect of the secondary circulation in depth-integrated flow models are inaccurate for moderately to strongly curved flows. PART III "Fundamental research" investigates the physical mechanisms and processes underlying these observations, mainly by making term-by-term evaluations of the relevant flow equations (momentum, vorticity, turbulent kinetic energy) and by considering the instantaneous flow behavior. The distribution of the downstream velocity is dominated by both cells of secondary circulation, whereby the outer-bank cell has a protective effect on the stability of the outer bank by keeping the core of maximum velocity at distance. The center-region cell is mainly generated by the vertical gradient of the centrifugal force, : the non-uniform outward centrifugal force and the nearly-uniform inward pressure gradient, due to the super-elevation of the water surface, are on the average in equilibrium; their local non-equilibrium, however, gives rise to the centerregion cell. There exists a strong negative feedback between the vertical profile of the downstream velocity, vs, and the center-region cell: the center-region cell flattens the vs-profiles, which on its turn leads to a reduction of and a weakening of the center-region cell. Linear models that are commonly used to account for the effect of the secondary circulation in depth-integrated flow models perform poorly because they neglect this feedback. Similar outer-bank cells exist in straight turbulent flow as well as in curved laminar flow. In straight turbulent flow, they are induced by the anisotropy of turbulence whereas they come into existence in curved laminar flow when the curvature exceeds a critical value: the vs-profiles flatten to such an extent that the gradient of the centrifugal force changes sign near the water surface, ~{$<~$}0, provocating the generation of the outer-bank cell. In curved turbulent flow, both mechanisms have a comparable contribution to the generation of the outer-bank cell and strengthen each other, whence the outer-bank cell is stronger in a curved turbulent flow than in a curved laminar or a straight turbulent flow. The restitution of kinetic energy from the turbulence to the mean flow plays an important role in the generation of the outer-bank cell, and the deficiency of standard k-{$\epsilon$} turbulence closures to accurately simulate them is due to their inherent incapability to account for such kinetic-energy restitution. The turbulence structure is fundamentally different than in a straight-uniform flow: for the same amount of turbulent kinetic energy, there is less shear in a curved flow. This change in turbulence structure is responsible for the observed reduced turbulence activity. An analysis of the instantaneous flow behavior suggests that the turbulence fluctuations can be decomposed into two fundamentally different parts: a wave-like oscillation of the pattern of circulation cells embedded in background turbulence. PART IV "Applied research" tries to apply the acquired knowledge in an engineering sense. It proposes a non-linear model to account for the effect of the secondary circulation in depth-integrated flow models, that simulates the negative feedback between the downstream velocity profile and the center-region cell. Contrary to the commonly used linear models, this non-linear model agrees well with experimental data for strongly curved flow from both the small and the large-flume experiments. The model depends on the curvature ratio, the friction factor and the spanwise distribution of the downstream velocity, which can all be incorporated in a newly defined bend parameter, that allows an objective definition of weak, moderate and strong curvature. The linear model is found as the asymptotic solution for vanishing curvature. An evaluation for natural rivers has shown that differences between the linear model and the non-linear model are relevant. Moreover, outer-bank cells have been successfully simulated by means of a non-linear k-{$\epsilon$} turbulence closure. As mentioned before, the small-flume experiments yielded results beyond all expectations. As a side-effect, the analysis of the large-flume experiments could not be accomplished within this dissertation and the work that is presently in progress is briefly described in PART V "Work in progress". Finally, PART VI summarizes the main conclusions of this dissertation},

  abstract = {Flow in open-channel bends is characterized by cross-stream circulation, which redistributes the velocity and the boundary shear stress and thereby shapes the characteristic bed topography. Besides a center-region cell, classical helical motion, a weaker counterrotating outer-bank cell often exists. In spite of its engineering importance, the mechanisms underlying distributions of the velocity and the boundary shear stress in open-channel bends, and especially the role of both circulation cells, are not yet fully understood. In order to investigate these mechanisms, an evaluation is made of the various terms in the momentum equations based on the data measured, which gave the following results. The outer-bank cell forms a buffer layer that protects the outer bank from any influence of the center-region cell and keeps the core of maximum velocity a distance from the bank. Advective momentum transport by the center-region cell is a dominant mechanism; it significantly contributes to the observed outward shift of the downstream velocity and the bed shear stress and to flattening of the vertical profiles of the velocity. This important advective momentum redistribution has to be included in the depth-integrated flow models often used in engineering practice. Commonly used linear models overpredict the effects of the center-region cell. Based on results of the analysis of experimental data, these models are extended by accounting for the feedback between the center-region cell and the downstream velocity. The nonlinear model obtained clearly reveals the mechanisms of the center-region cell and its advective momentum transport. An analysis of nonlinear model results confirms and complements the analysis of experimental data. A true quasithree-dimensional flow model is obtained by coupling this nonlinear model to depth-integrated flow models, thus providing an engineering tool for morphodynamical investigations.},

  abstract = {Boundary shear stress and flow variability due to its interaction with main flow and secondary currents were investigated under conditions that extend previous research on trapezoidal channels. Secondary currents that scale with the flow depth were found over the entire width in all experiments. These findings contradict the widespread perception that secondary currents die out at a distance of 2.5 times the flow depth from the bank, a perception which is largely based on experiments with smooth boundaries. The reported results indicate that a stable pattern of secondary currents over the entire channel width can only be sustained over a fixed horizontal bed if the bed's roughness is sufficient to provide the required transverse oscillations in the turbulent shear stresses. Contrary to laboratory flumes, alluvial river bed always provide sufficient roughness. The required external forcing of this hydrodynamic instability mechanism is provided by the turbulence-generated near-bank secondary currents. The pattern of near-bank secondary currents depends on the inclination and the roughness of the bank. In all configurations, secondary currents result in a reduction of the bed shear stress in the vicinity of the bank and a heterogeneous bank shear stress that reaches a maximum close to the toe of the bank. Moreover, these currents cause transverse variability of 10{\textendash}15\% for the streamwise velocities and 0.2u*2{\textendash}0.3u2* for the bed shear stress. These variations are insufficient to provide the flow variability required in river restoration projects, but nevertheless must be accounted for in the design of stable channels.},

  abstract = {Interest in producing cellulosic ethanol from renewable energy sources is growing. Potential energy crops include row crops such as corn (Zea mays L.), perennial warm-season grasses (WSGs), and short-rotation woody crops (SRWCs). However, impacts of growing dedicated energy crops as biofuel on soil and environment have not been well documented. This article reviews the (i) impacts of growing WSGs and SRWCs on soil properties, soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, and water quality, and (ii) performance of energy crops in marginal lands. Literature shows that excessive ({$\geq$}50\%) crop residue removal adversely impacts soil and environmental quality as well as crop yields. Growing WSGs and SRWCs can be potential alternatives to crop residue removal as biofuel. Warm-season grasses and SRWCs can improve soil properties, reduce soil erosion, and sequester SOC. Crop residue removal reduces SOC concentration by 1 to 3 Mg ha-1 yr-1 in the top 10 cm, whereas growing WSGs and SRWCs increase SOC concentration while providing biofuel feedstocks. The WSGs can store SOC between 0 and 3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the top 5 cm of soil, while the SRWCs can store between 0 and 1.6 Mg ha-1 yr-1 of SOC in the top 100 cm. The WSGs and SRWCs have more beneficial effects on soil and environment when grown in marginal lands than when grown in croplands or natural forests. Indeed, they can grow in nutrient-depleted, compacted, poorly drained, acid, and eroded soils. Development of sustainable systems of WSGs and SRWCs in marginal lands is a high priority.},

  abstract = {Much research has been spent in the last three decades in developing more effective and efficient automatic calibration procedures and in demonstrating their applicability to hydrological problems. Several problems have emerged when applying these procedures to calibration of conceptual rainfall {\textendash}runoff and groundwater (GW) models, such as computational time, large number of calibration parameters, parameter identifiability, model response surface complexity, handling of multiple objectives and parameter equifinality. All these are expected to be much more severe for more complex models, for which comprehensive calibration studies have not so far been conducted. The scope of this paper is to investigate the performance of a global and a local optimisation technique, respectively, the Shuffled Complex Evolution algorithm and the gradientbased Gauss {\textendash}Marquard {\textendash}Levenberg algorithm, in calibration of physically based distributed models of different complexity. The models considered are a steady-state GW model, a transient GW model and a fully integrated model of the same catchment. The calibration is conducted in a multi-objective framework where two different aspects of the model response, the simulated runoff and the groundwater elevation are aggregated and simultaneously optimised. Different aggregated objective functions are used to give different weights to the calibration criteria. The results of the calibration procedures are compared in terms of effectiveness and efficiency and demonstrate the different performance of the methods. Moreover, a combination of the global and local techniques is investigated as an attempt to exploit the advantages of both procedures, while overcoming their drawbacks.},

Numerical results indicate that the Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt method is more adept at problems with few unknowns (i.e. 63), but as the number of unknowns increases, CMA-ES becomes the superior strategy. Results also indicate that a parallel version of CMA-ES would be more robust than, and have competitive run times with, the Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt method for many inverse transport problems.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of four sediment continuity models for nonuniform sediment by applying these models to an aggradational flume experiment that is dominated by nonuniform sediment and dunes. The author makes simulations of the flume experiment using four numerical morphodynamic model systems to which the following sediment continuity models are applied: the commonly applied active layer model (A), a two-layer model (B), a sorting evolution model while assuming bed form size to be regular (C1), and a sorting evolution model while taking into account the variability in bed form geometry (C2). The model systems that incorporate the variability of bed form geometry, i.e., the two-layer model and the sorting evolution model with irregular dunes, show an improved prediction of the adaptation timescale of the composition of both the bed surface and the transported sediment, as well as the vertical sorting profile. This is because including the variability of bed form geometry enables the model system to account for sediment being stored (temporarily) at elevations that are exposed to the flow less frequently. Future application of both models to field cases is difficult, however, as the two-layer model is not sufficiently generic and may lead to ellipticity of its set of equations, whereas the sorting evolution model requires a very small numerical time step.},

  abstract = {This paper is the outcome of a community initiative to identify major unsolved scientific problems in hydrology motivated by a need for stronger harmonisation of research efforts. The procedure involved a public consultation through online media, followed by two workshops through which a large number of potential science questions were collated, prioritised, and synthesised. In spite of the diversity of the participants (230 scientists in total), the process revealed much about community priorities and the state of our science: a preference for continuity in research questions rather than radical departures or redirections from past and current work. Questions remain focused on the process-based understanding of hydrological variability and causality at all space and time scales. Increased attention to environmental change drives a new emphasis on understanding how change propagates across interfaces within the hydrological system and across disciplinary boundaries. In particular, the expansion of the human footprint raises a new set of questions related to human interactions with nature and water cycle feedbacks in the context of complex water management problems. We hope that this reflection and synthesis of the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology will help guide research efforts for some years to come.},

  abstract = {Fifty years of hyporheic zone research have shown the important role played by the hyporheic zone as an interface between groundwater and surface waters. However, it is only in the last two decades that what began as an empirical science has become a mechanistic science devoted to modeling studies of the complex fluid dynamical and biogeochemical mechanisms occurring in the hyporheic zone. These efforts have led to the picture of surface-subsurface water interactions as regulators of the form and function of fluvial ecosystems. Rather than being isolated systems, surface water bodies continuously interact with the subsurface. Exploration of hyporheic zone processes has led to a new appreciation of their wide reaching consequences for water quality and stream ecology. Modern research aims toward a unified approach, in which processes occurring in the hyporheic zone are key elements for the appreciation, management, and restoration of the whole river environment. In this unifying context, this review summarizes results from modeling studies and field observations about flow and transport processes in the hyporheic zone and describes the theories proposed in hydrology and fluid dynamics developed to quantitatively model and predict the hyporheic transport of water, heat, and dissolved and suspended compounds from sediment grain scale up to the watershed scale. The implications of these processes for stream biogeochemistry and ecology are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Sustainability, equitable allocation and protection of water resources must occur within the framework of integrated management and water governance, but its implementation is problematic. Ongoing global climate change, increasing population, urbanization, and aspirations for better living standards present a challenge to the planetary sustainability. While water use at global scale currently seems to be within its planetary boundary, shortages prevail in several water-scarce and overpopulated regions, and are projected to increase. Furthermore large-scale impoverishment of aquatic biodiversity, ecosystem degradation and reductions in water quality are unaddressed `side effects' in areas where water can be secured for human and economic uses. As the world prepares for Rio+20, challenges to the sustainability of global water security should be scrutinized. Of particular concern is the likelihood that the water-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) targets may not be achievable due to lack of funding commitments, and a failure of delivery mechanisms including water governance. Constraints on water availability and reductions in water quality jeopardize secure access to this resource for all legitimate stakeholders, including aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Water connects several socio-ecological, economic and geophysical systems at multiple scales and hence constitutes a `global water system'. This should be considered both in technical interventions and in governance frameworks. Humans have been changing the global water system in globally significant ways since the industrial revolution, yet without adequate knowledge of the system and its response to change; and without sufficient understanding of how to govern the system at local and global scales. Water security in the 21st century will require better linkage of science and policy, as well as innovative and cross-sectoral initiatives, adaptive management and polycentric governance models that involve all stakeholders. Consensus solutions will need to be achieved by evidence-based mediation, rather than following untested `panaceas', so as to ensure equitable and sustainable global water use.},

Firstly, a 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is used to investigate the flow patterns and velocity profiles. Numerical simulation in two phases is done using the ANSYS-CFX software and k-{$\epsilon$} turbulence model is used to solve turbulence equations. The results show secondary flow and centrifugal force influenced flow pattern and have good agreement with experimental data. Then two similar ANNs are trained based on GA and Back-Error Propagation (BEP) technique for velocity prediction in different sections of bend and their test results are compared with each other and with actual data. Since obtaining experimental data in every point of channel is not easy, ANN is used to obtain the velocity in some sections where experimental data are not available, and the results are compared with CFX's result.},

We find high water debts, indicating unsustainable production, for potatoes, pulses, grapes, cotton, rice, and wheat due to irrigation in arid areas. Climate change scenarios suggest an intensification of such pressure on water resources, especially in regions already vulnerable, with a country-scale increase in irrigation demand of between 6.5\% and 32\% by 2090. Future land use planning and management should carefully consider the spatial distribution and local sustainability of crop water requirements to reduce water consumption in water risk hotspots and guarantee long-term food security.},

  abstract = {The overall aim of this research was to investigate the spatial patterns of the soil erosion risk. We focused on accelerated soil erosion processes in an Italian central Apennine intermountain watershed using modeling techniques implemented in a GIS environment. Our thorough literature review revealed a gap in research on soil erosion processes in such forested, intermountain watersheds. To gain a better understanding of the soil erosion processes in such landscapes, we proposed an integrated modeling approach applying a RUSLE model and a Turbidity Unit Index. The model outcomes were validated through measurements of lake sediment deposition. Our findings indicate a potential high soil erosion risk. With 1.33Mt-1yr-1 of annual sediment yield, corresponding to an area-specific sediment yield of 32.35tha-1yr-1, the Turano drainage basin belongs to the Italian basins with the highest sediment discharge. The outcomes of the RUSLE model showed that, despite the diverse forms of forests that cover about 62\% of the drainage basin area, sizable plots of the investigated area are prone to soil erosion. The validation of the model outcomes revealed that the TU Index model performed significantly better than the RUSLE model with regard to sediment yield prediction. Accordingly, we found that even though rill and interrill processes reach very alarming values (RUSLE), they are not the dominant sediment source within the Turano watershed. Other geomorphological processes contributing to the watershed sediment yield {\textendash} for instance, megarill, gully, bank and channel erosion and re-entrainment of landslide sediments {\textendash} were very active in the study area. If both models are used in a combined approach, the amount of river load (TU Index) as well as the relative spatial distribution of rill and interrill erosion processes (RUSLE) can be described with sufficient precision.},

  abstract = {As a member of the European Union, Italy has committed to the maintenance and protection of its forests based on sustainable forest development and management practices. According to Eurostat, Italy has the seventh largest forest surface available for wood supply in the EU-28, which is equal to 8.086 million hectares. For 2012, the Italian National Institute of Statistics estimated the total roundwood production of Italy to be 7.7 million m3, from a harvested forest surface of 61,038ha. Large parts of the country's forests, mainly located in vulnerable mountainous landscapes that are highly sensitive to environmental changes, are subject to anthropogenic disturbance driven by wood supply interests. Despite the extensive logging activities and the well-known impacts that such management practices have on the soil-related forest ecosystems, there is a lack of spatially and temporally explicit information about the removal of trees. Hence, this study aims to: i) assess the soil loss by water erosion in Italian forest areas, ii) map forest harvests and iii) evaluate the effects of logging activities in terms of soil loss by means of comprehensive remote sensing and GIS modelling techniques. The study area covers about 785.6{\texttimes}104ha, which corresponds to the main forest units of the CORINE land cover 2006 database (i.e. broad-leaved forests, coniferous forests and mixed forests). Annual forest logging activities were mapped using Landsat imagery. Validation procedures were applied. A revised version of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was used to predict the soil loss potential due to rill and inter-rill processes. To ensure a thorough modelling approach, the input parameters were calculated using the original methods reported in the USDA handbooks. The derived high-resolution data regarding forest cover change shows that 317,535ha (4.04\% of the total forest area in Italy) were harvested during the period under review. The predicted long-term annual average soil loss rate was 0.54Mgha-1yr-1. The average rate of soil loss in forests that remained undisturbed during the modelled period is equal to 0.33Mgha-1yr-1. Notably, about half of the soil loss (45.3\%) was predicted for the logged areas, even though these cover only about 10.6\% of the Italian forests. The identified erosion hotspots may represent a serious threat for the soil-related forest ecosystems, and are in contrast to the EC Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection and Water Framework Directive.},

Moreover, we estimate the spatial and temporal effects of land use change between 2001 and 2012 and the potential offset of the global application of conservation practices.

  abstract = {Soil degradation due to erosion is connected to two serious environmental impacts: (i) on-site soil loss and (ii) off-site effects of sediment transfer through the landscape. The potential impact of soil erosion processes on biogeochemical cycles has received increasing attention in the last two decades. Properly designed modelling assumptions on effective soil loss are a key pre-requisite to improve our understanding of the magnitude of nutrients that are mobilized through soil erosion and the resultant effects. The aim of this study is to quantify the potential spatial displacement and transport of soil sediments due to water erosion at European scale. We computed long-term averages of annual soil loss and deposition rates by means of the extensively tested spatially distributed WaTEM/SEDEM model. Our findings indicate that soil loss from Europe in the riverine systems is about 15\% of the estimated gross on-site erosion. The estimated sediment yield totals 0.164 {$\pm$} 0.013 Pg yr-1 (which corresponds to 4.62 {$\pm$} 0.37 Mg ha-1 yr-1 in the erosion area). The greatest amount of gross on-site erosion as well as soil loss to rivers occurs in the agricultural land (93.5\%). By contrast, forestland and other semi-natural vegetation areas experience an overall surplus of sediments which is driven by a re-deposition of sediments eroded from agricultural land. Combining the predicted soil loss rates with the European soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, we estimate a SOC displacement by water erosion of 14.5 Tg yr-1. The SOC potentially transferred to the riverine system equals to 2.2 Tg yr-1 ({\textasciitilde}15\%). Integrated sediment delivery-biogeochemical models need to answer the question on how carbon mineralization during detachment and transport might be balanced or even off-set by carbon sequestration due to dynamic replacement and sediment burial.},

  abstract = {Meso-scale classification of rivers has been used for decades in hydrology and ecology. Recent research has demonstrated a large potential for using this in ecohydraulics. Habitat modellers have to look at complex systems (e.g. catchments), where problems inherent in applying models developed for small scales applied for larger scales need to be overcome. The use of hydro-morphological units linked to meso-habitats extends the information and helps bypassing the problems arising from scale alteration. The process is called upscaling. This paper presents a physical approach for mesohabitat assessment in small to medium sized rivers, with the purpose of serving as a scaling tool for physical habitat information from micro-scale to macro-scale. Results of the assessment are to be used for population modelling of juvenile Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar). The system has been tested in Norway and in Great Britain on rivers of various sizes, has a flexible structure, so that it can be adapted to different situations and problems and is also rapid regarding habitat mapping.},

The hyporheic zone below the channel and banks of many rivers where surface water and ground water exchanges plays a crucial functional role in the biogeochemical transformation of water, mediated by active microbial biofilms. This zone also harbours assemblages of invertebrates that graze biofilms, contribute to secondary production, and can alter the porosity of the hyporheic zone through their movement or burrowing activities. 2. Many human activities cause interstitial sedimentation or disrupt surface{\textendash}groundwater hydrological linkages, impacting upon ecological processes in the hyporheic zone. However, strategies for river rehabilitation seldom explicitly consider the hyporheic zone or seek to restore lost vertical linkages with groundwater. Instead, restoration goals target surface, riparian or floodplain features even though current river ecosystem theory emphasises the three dimensions of hydrological connectivity. To guide effective, holistic river restoration, scientists and managers therefore need information on the mechanisms by which energy and material are transferred in the hyporheic zone and which ecosystem services are thus provided. 3. Other gaps in our understanding of hyporheic zone rehabilitation include recruitment processes of the hyporheos and the relative importance of groups of hyporheic invertebrates in rivers differing in substratum size, disturbance frequency and groundwater linkages. Carefully designed experiments that assess responses to hyporheic rehabilitation strategies will provide valuable data at varying scales (e.g. distribution of hyporheic habitat types at the reach scale) for management as well as providing insights into the mechanisms controlling hyporheic invertebrate assemblages and ecological processes. Fully successful river rehabilitation must include restoration of vertical linkages between the river and its shallow groundwater aquifers.},

  abstract = {Horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity, symbols Kh and Kv, respectively, of anisotropic soils in which the principal conductivity components are in the horizontal and vertical directions, can be measured with the double-tube method. The principle is based on manipulation of flow direction in the artificially saturated soil region below the auger hole. As with the original double-tube method, the presence of a water table is not required. If the water levels in the inner and the outer tube differ, the streamlines in the resulting flow system below the auger hole have both horizontal and vertical portions. Thus, the hydraulic conductivity measured with the conventional double-tube method from this flow system on the basis of assumed isotropy, symbol Kdt, is some resultant of Kh and Kv. If the water levels in the inner and the outer tube are the same, the flow in the soil below the inner tube is, initially, vertically downward. Piezometers are used to measure the vertical hydraulic gradient and knowing the intake rate, Kv can be computed. By transformation to equivalent isotropic systems, the relationship between Kdt/Kv and Kh/Kv can be determined and expressed in the form of a graph. Thus, knowing Kdt and Kv, the conductivity Kh can be evaluated from that graph. Laboratory studies on artificial anisotropic soil consisting of alternating 0.5-cm. layers of coarse and fine soil were performed to verify and exemplify the method.},

FLIP is an adaptation to fluids of the implicit moment method for simulating plasmas, in which particles carry everything necessary to describe the fluid. Using the particle data, Lagrangian moment equations are solved on a grid. The solutions are then used to advance the particle variables from time step to time step. An adaptive grid and implicit time differencing extend the method to multiple time and space scale flows. Aspects of FLIP's properties are illustrated by modeling of a confined eddy, a Rayleigh-Taylor, an unstable subsonic stream, and a supersonic jet. The results demonstrate FLIP's instability applicability to hydrodynamic stability problems where low dissipation is crucial to correct modeling.}

The frictional force is typically characterized by a drag coefficient Cd, which is estimated from bulk measurements and often assumed constant. Here, we demonstrate a relationship between bed roughness and water surface turbulence that can be used to make remote estimates of Cd. We observe that regions with larger bed roughness result in greater turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), which is transported upward by river boils to the water surface. We present a relationship between surface TKE and Cd, and validate this relationship by comparing remotely sensed estimates of Cd to those from in situ measurements. Thus, our results provide an approach for estimating bottom roughness and Cd based entirely on remotely sensed data, including their spatial variability, which can improve modeling of river discharge and morphodynamics in data-poor regions.},

  abstract = {Large woody debris is an integral component of forested, fluvial systems throughout the world, yet we know little about hydraulic thresholds for movement and transport of logs. We developed theoretical models of entrainment and performed flume experiments to examine thresholds for wood movement in streams. Both the model and the experiments indicate that log entrainment is primarily a function of the piece angle relative to flow direction, whether or not the log had a rootwad, the density of the log, and the piece diameter. Stability increased if the pieces had rootwads or were rotated parallel to flow. Although previously reported as the most important factor in piece stability, piece length did not significantly affect the threshold of movement in our experiments or our physically based model, for logs shorter than channel width. These physically based models offer a first-order approach to evaluating the stability of either naturally derived woody debris or material deliberately introduced to streams for various management objectives.},

A method for incorporating model uncertainty from a range of sources is discussed as a first step towards using and learning from results produced through the GLUE (Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) technique. Results are presented and compared to available observed data, which illustrate that levels of uncertainty are significant and must be taken into account if a meaningful understanding of output from models such as WEPP is to be achieved. Furthermore, the collection of quality, observed data is underlined for two reasons: as an essential tool in the development of soil erosion modelling and also to allow further constraint of model uncertainty.

Natural occurrence is limited in time and space at temperatures above 18{\textdegree}C despite being able to tolerate 24{\textdegree}C. Forms of physiological inadequacy can be demonstrated which account for such restrictions in distribution. Predictive power for locating and accounting for concentrations of young fish in thermally stratified lakes appeared to provide ``proof'' for the controlling influence of the physiological optimum temperature. Early literature on the ecology of sockeye supported this view. Recent studies using midwater trawls and sonar detection reveal a diurnal behavior pattern which points to a more subtle interaction of biotic andabiotic factors governing vertical distribution in which the controlling force appears to be bioenergetic efficiency. It is concluded that a mechanism of behavioral thermoregulation has evolved which favorably balances daily metabolic expenditures in order to conserve energy when food is limited.}

  abstract = {Scour is the number one cause of bridge failures. Scour in coarse grained soils (sand, gravel) is relatively well known, but scour in fine grained soils (silt, clay) and weak rock is not. In coarse grained soils, scour takes place very rapidly and the scour rate is rarely an issue because one flood is likely to create the maximum scour depth. In fine grained soils, the scour process is much slower; as a result, even after a hundred years, a bridge may not experience the maximum depth of scour. Therefore, in fine grained soils it becomes necessary to predict the rate at which scour takes place. A new apparatus called the EFA (Erosion Function Apparatus; ͗http://tti.tamu.edu/geotech/scour͘) has been built and tested to measure the erosion rate of fine grained soils; the EFA can also be used to measure the erosion rate of coarse grained soils if necessary. The end of a Shelby tube sample from the bridge site is fitted through a tight opening at the bottom of a pipe with a rectangular cross section. Water flows through the pipe and erodes the soil sample, which protrudes 1 mm above the bottom of the pipe. The rate at which the sample erodes is measured, and the shear stress imposed by the water on the soil is calculated. The plot of erosion rate versus shear stress is the result of an EFA test. It indicates the critical shear stress at which erosion starts and the rate of erosion beyond that shear stress. This function can be used to predict the rate of scour at a bridge.},

  abstract = {This lecture presents four case history examples of erosion processes. Because the topic of soil and rock erosion is relatively underdeveloped in geotechnical engineering, an introduction precedes the case histories to describe some fundamental aspects of erosion. Erosion involves the soil or rock through its erodibility, the water through its velocity, and the geometry of the obstacle through its size and shape. Knowledge of these three components is needed for any erosion problem to be studied and solved. A set of fundamental issues are addressed in the first part including an erodibility classification for soils and rocks, an explanation of the stresses imposed by the water on the soil-water or rock-water interface, and an explanation of how the geometry impacts the problem. The Woodrow Wilson Bridge case history outlines a new and less conservative method to compute the scour depth and gives examples of bridge scour calculations. The Brazos River meander case history outlines a new method to predict meander migration and gives an example of migration calculations. The Pointe du Hoc case history gives an explanation of a process of rock cliff erosion. The New Orleans levees case history gives an example of erosion of levees by overtopping and proposes an erosion design chart for levee overtopping. Whenever possible the results are presented in a probabilistic fashion. All case histories make use of the erosion function apparatus, an apparatus developed to quantify the erodibility of a soil or rock and to give the constitutive law for erosion problems: the erosion function. The power point slides for the lecture including many photos of the case histories are available at ͗http://ceprofs.tamu.edu/briaud/͘ under ``Lectures'' and the video ͑DVD͒ of the lecture is available from the author, free of charge.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of erodibility is essential to the analysis of problems related to soil erosion including bridge scour, embankment and floodwall overtopping, dam spillway erosion, stream stability, and meander migration. Many investigators have attempted to classify erodibility according to basic engineering soil properties such as Atterberg limits, unit weight, water content, and shear strength. In general, the more successful of these attempts were those that studied the erodibility of coarse-grained materials due to the fact that the erosion resistance of such soils is primarily influenced by gravity and friction, and not the more complex electrostatic and electromagnetic forces that influence fine-grained soils behavior. This paper describes a way of assessing erodibility by presenting erodibility classification charts and erosion threshold charts for different soil types. These charts are developed from soil erosion test data as well as related experience of the authors and are meant to be used by practicing engineers as a first-order estimate in their erosion analyses. The paper also presents nonlinear models correlating soil erodibility parameters to the soil geotechnical properties. A practical example of the use of the charts is given to illustrate their application in practice.

  abstract = {Models of braided-river deposition must be detailed, fully 3D, and preferably quantitative to be of use in understanding and predicting the nature of ancient deposits. In order to construct and validate adequate predictive models it is necessary to have information on: (1) variation and interaction of channel geometry, water flow and sediment transport in time and space in modern channel belts, as these control erosion and deposition, the formation and migration of channels and bars, and channel abandonment and filling; (2) 3D variation of bed geometry, texture, sedimentary structures and paleocurrents throughout modern channel-belt deposits, including the age and spatial arrangement of preserved parts of bars and channel fills; (3) long-term (more than hundreds of years) trends in channel and floodplain geometry, flow and sedimentary processes in order to understand channel-belt movements such as avulsions, and the spatial arrangement of channel-belt deposits relative to overbank deposits. Such information is rare because: (1) it is difficult to study modern braided-river geometry, flow and sedimentary processes throughout a range of the all-important high discharges; (2) detailed reconstructions of braided channel and bar geometry and movement are only available for the past halfcentury and cannot readily be linked to causative mechanisms; (3) 3D documentation of modern deposits below the water table (especially large scale features like lateral-accretion bedding) requires extensive coring and dating of the deposits, and geophysical profiling. As a result of this lack of information, and because of the quality of analysis and presentation of the information available, existing braided-river facies models are virtually useless as interpretive and predictive tools. The nature of the information available is critically reviewed. Using information from recent detailed field and laboratory studies of the geometry, flow and sedimentary processes in braided rivers of simple geometry, in single river bends, in channel confluences, and using some theoretical reasoning, it has been possible to construct fully 3D qualitative and quantitative models of braided river deposits. These models can be used to provide sophisticated quantitative interpretations of palaeochannel geometry, hydraulics and migration, as illustrated by comparison with some particularly well described examples of ancient braided river deposits.},

  abstract = {Nature-based measures (NBMs), understood here as measures such as floodplain restoration that use ecosystem processes to meet societal challenges, are increasingly advocated as promising solutions for managing flood risks. A suitable instrument to implement NBMs are flood risk management plans (FRMPs) stipulated by the EU Floods Directive. While prior research suggests several governance challenges for NBM uptake in FRMPs, little is known so far regarding the actual extent of NBM uptake and its role in decision-making of flood risk management. Germany, with a coherent water policy framework but state-specific implementation conditions, provides a suitable case study for exploring the decision-making practices that are used in the planning process for FRMPs by German federal states with different water governance characteristics. The aim of this study is to analyze the actual uptake of NBMs in German FRMPs, and to explore potential factors of the FRMP preparation and decision-making practices explaining this uptake. Our explorative research design is based on a document analysis method which assesses the contents of FRMPs of three German federal states. The results offer the first empirical evidence of the uptake of NBMs in Germany and insights into how NBMs and other measure types are chosen for FRMPs. Our findings confirm an overall low uptake of NBMs, with diverging preferences for particular NBM types between the three states. Looking across the states, the level of NBM uptake is likely to be higher if rivers with higher stream order are considered in the FRMP's spatial scope, the potential flood risk in a river basin is low, and positive flood impacts and positive cost-benefit ratios are expected. We conclude that FRMPs still hold substantial potential to enhance the NBM uptake in flood risk management planning. To make use of this potential, we suggest three key strategies to increase the change for a better NBM uptake including applying FRMPs at different spatial levels and degrees of details.},

However, recent studies have observed a tendency for policy search methods to overfit to the hydrologic data used in training, particularly the sequence of flood and drought events. This technical note develops an extension of bootstrap aggregation (bagging) and cross-validation techniques, inspired by the machine learning literature, to improve reservoir control policy performance on out-of-sample hydrological sequences. We explore these methods using a case study of Folsom Reservoir, California, using control policies structured as binary trees, and streamflow resampling based on the paleo-inflow record. Results show that calibration-validation strategies for policy selection coupled with certain ensemble aggregation methods can improve out-of-sample performance in water supply and flood risk objectives over baseline performance given fixed computational costs. Our findings highlight the potential to improve policy search methodologies by leveraging these well-established model training strategies from machine learning.},

To understand and summarize the state of the science of rendering artificial river topography, we reviewed {$>$}225 scientific articles and produced a road map for artificial synthesis of digital river topography. We broadly classify methods of digital river synthesis by whether they are driven by expert-based decisions or are strategic in the use of rules for objective rendering, with some rules being physics-based theories of river morphogenesis. Expert approaches include map, brush, geometric and interactive design. Strategic approaches include deterministic equilibrium models, morphodynamic models, and stochastic approaches. For each approach we discuss the conceptual basis for each method and how they can be applied. Readers can then identify what methods can create different types of digital riverscapes. We close by discussing how cross pollination can serve geomorphology and computer science, the role of digital rivers in furthering geoscience progress, and future directions in digital river synthesis.},

  abstract = {1. This review focuses on the connectivity between river and groundwater ecosystems, viewing them as linked components of a hydrological continuum. Ecological processes that maintain the integrity of both systems and those that are mediated by their ecotones are evaluated. 2. The hyporheic zone, as the connecting ecotone, shows diverse gradients. Thus it can be characterized by hydrological, chemical, zoological and metabolic criteria. However, the characteristics of the hyporheic zone tend to vary widely in space and time as well as from system to system. The exact limits are difficult to designate and the construction of static concepts is inadequate for the representation of ecological processes. The hyporheic interstices are functionally a part of both the fluvial and groundwater ecosystems. 3. The permeability of the ecotone depends on the hydraulic conductivity of the sediment layers which, because of their heterogeneity, form many flowpath connections between the stream and the catchment, from the small scale of a single microhabitat to the large scale of an entire alluvial aquifer. Local up- and downwellings are determined by geomorphologic features such as streambed topography, whereas large-scale exchange processes are determined mainly by the geological properties of the catchment. Colmation{\textemdash}clogging of the top layer of the channel sediments{\textemdash}includes all processes leading to a reduction of pore volume, consolidation of the sediment matrix, and decreased permeability of the stream bed. Consequently, colmation can hinder exchange processes between surface water and groundwater. 4. Physicochemical gradients in the interstices result from several processes: (i) hyporheic flow pattern and the different properties of surface and groundwaters; (ii) retention, caused by the filtering effect of pore size and lithologic sorption as well as the transient storage of solutes caused by diminished water velocities; (iii) biogeochemical transformations in conjunction with local residence time. Each physicochemical parameter may develop its own vertical dynamics laterally from the active channel into the banks as well as longitudinally because of geomorphologic changes. 5. The river{\textendash}groundwater interface can act as a source or sink for dissolved organic matter, depending on the volume and direction of flow, dissolved organic carbon concentrations and biotic activity. Interstitial storage of particulate organic matter is influenced mainly by grain size distribution and by spates involving bedload movement that may import or release matter, depending on the season. After initial transient and abiotic storage, hyporheic organic matter is mobilized and transformed by the biota. Micro-organisms account for over 90\% of the community respiration. In subterranean waters most bacteria are attached to surfaces and remain in a biofilm. 6. Hyporheic interstices are functionally significant for phreatic and riverine metazoans because they act as a refuge against adverse conditions. The net flow direction exerts a dominant influence on interstitial colonization, but many other factors also seem to be important in structuring the hyporheos. 7. The hyporheic corridor concept emphasizes connectivity and interactions between subterranean and surface flow on an ecosystem level for floodplain rivers. It is a complementary concept to others which focus on surficial processes in the lateral and longitudinal dimensions. 8. The ecological integrity of groundwater and fluvial systems is often threatened by human activities: (i) by reducing connectivity; (ii) by altering exchange processes; and (iii) by toxic or organic contamination.},

This paper reviews state of the art approaches in characterizing and modeling river and groundwater interactions. Our review covers a wide range of approaches, including remote sensing to characterize the streambed, emerging methods to measure exchange fluxes between rivers and groundwater, and developments in several disciplines relevant to the river-groundwater interface. We discuss approaches for automated calibration, and real-time modeling, which improve the simulation and understanding of river-groundwater interactions. Although the integration of these various approaches and disciplines is advancing, major research gaps remain to be filled to allow more complete and quantitative integration across disciplines. New possibilities for generating realistic distributions of streambed properties, in combination with more data and novel data types, have great potential to improve our understanding and predictive capabilities for river-groundwater systems, especially in combination with the integrated simulation of the river and groundwater flow as well as calibration methods. Understanding the implications of different data types and resolution, the development of highly instrumented field sites, ongoing model development, and the ultimate integration of models and data are important future research areas. These developments are required to expand our current understanding to do justice to the complexity of natural systems.},

Still, the multivariate nature of floods and droughts is often ignored by studying individual characteristics only, which can lead to the under- or overestimation of risk. Studying multivariate extremes is challenging because of variable dependencies and because they are even less abundant in observational records than univariate extremes. In this review, I discuss different types of multivariate hydrological extremes and their dependencies, including regional extremes affecting multiple locations, such as spatially connected flood events; consecutive extremes occurring in close temporal succession, such as successive droughts; extremes characterized by multiple characteristics, such as floods with jointly high peak discharge and flood volume; and transitions between different types of extremes, such as drought-to-flood transitions. I present different strategies to describe and model multivariate extremes and to assess their hazard potential, including descriptors of multivariate extremes, multivariate distributions and return periods, and stochastic and large-ensemble simulation approaches. The strategies discussed enable a multivariate perspective on hydrological extremes, which allows us to derive risk estimates for extreme events described by more than one variable.},

  abstract = {Textural patches (i.e., grain-size facies) are commonly observed in gravel-bed channels and are of significance for both physical and biological processes at subreach scales. We present a general framework for classifying textural patches that allows modification for particular study goals, while maintaining a basic degree of standardization. Textures are classified using a two-tier system of ternary diagrams that identifies the relative abundance of major size classes and subcategories of the dominant size. An iterative procedure of visual identification and quantitative grain-size measurement is used. A field test of our classification indicates that it affords reasonable statistical discrimination of median grain size and variance of bed-surface textures. We also explore the compromise between classification simplicity and accuracy. We find that statistically meaningful textural discrimination requires use of both tiers of our classification. Furthermore, we find that simplified variants of the two-tier scheme are less accurate but may be more practical for field studies which do not require a high level of textural discrimination or detailed description of grain-size distributions. Facies maps provide a natural template for stratifying other physical and biological measurements and produce a retrievable and versatile database that can be used as a component of channel monitoring efforts.},

In the code, the flow field is calculated by solving the full Reynolds-averaged Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations with k{\textendash}e turbulence model; the bed-load transport is simulated with a non-equilibrium model containing an important parameter, the so-called non-equilibrium adaptation length, which characterizes the distance for sediment to adjust from a non-equilibrium state to an equilibrium state; the bed deformation is obtained from an overall mass-balance equation for sediment transport. The governing equations are solved numerically with a finite volume method on an adaptive, non-staggered grid. The former model assumed uniform bed material. In order to take into account the influence of grain-size distribution of the bed-surface on the evolution of the bed topography and consequently also on the flow field, a sediment transport module has been presently developed by the authors at the Institute of Hydraulic and Water Resources Engineering, Technische Universita{\textasciidieresis} t Mu{\textasciidieresis} nchen, Germany, for fractional sediment transport using a multiple layer model. This paper presents the numerical results for sediment sorting and the bed deformation in a curved alluvial channel under unsteady-flow conditions according to Yen and Lee (1995). The calculations were compared with data from laboratory measurements. Further, the sensitivity of the simulated results to the non-equilibrium adaptation length is investigated.},

In recent years, the evaluation of changes of void in bed materials has attracted more concern. However, analyzing the morphological changes and grain size distribution that are associated with the porosity variations in gravel-bed rivers are still challenging. This study develops a new model using a multi-layer\&rsquo;s concept to simulate morphological changes and grain size distribution, taking into account the porosity variabilities in a gravel-bed river based on the mass conservation for each size fraction and the exchange of fine sediments between the surface and subsurface layers. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is applied to model infiltration processes and to confirm the effects of the relative size of fine sediment to gravel on the infiltration depth. Further, the exchange rate and the bed porosity are estimated while using empirical formulae. The new model was tested on three straight channels. Analyzing the calculated results and comparing with the observed data show that the new model can successfully simulate sediment transport, grain sorting processes, and bed change in gravel-bed rivers.},

The 0.9 m long trailing net can capture about 20 kg of gravel and cobbles. Traps are positioned on ground plates anchored in the streambed to minimize disturbance of the streambed during sampling. This design permits sampling times of up to 1 h, overcoming short-term temporal variability issues. Bedload traps were tested in two streams and appear to collect representative samples of gravel bedload transport. Bedload rating and flow competence curves are well-defined and steeper than those obtained by a Helley{\textendash}Smith sampler. Rating curves from both samplers differ most at low flow but approach each other near bankfull flow. Critical flow determined from bedload traps is similar using the largest grain and the small transport rate method, suggesting suitability of bedload trap data for incipient motion studies.},

Transport rates obtained from bedload traps increased steeply with flow which resulted in steep and well-defined transport rating curves with exponents of 8 to 16. Gravel transport rates measured by the Helley- Smith sampler started with much higher transport rates during low flows and increased less steeply, thus fitted bedload rating curves were less steep with exponents of 2 to 4. Transport rates measured with both samplers approached similar results near or above bankfull flow, but at 50 \% of bankfull, transport rates from the bedload traps were 2-4 orders of magnitude lower than those obtained from the Helley-Smith sampler. The maximum bedload particle sizes also differed between the two samplers. They were smaller in the bedload traps than the Helley-Smith sampler at low flows, while at higher flows bedload traps collected larger particles than the Helley-Smith sampler. Differences in sampler opening size and sampling time contribute to the measured differences, but the biggest effect is likely attributable to the bedload traps being mounted on ground plates thus avoiding direct contact between the sampler and the bed and preventing involuntary particle pick up.},

Without the refinement, there is a significant dissipation of energy in modeling elastic vibrations of a solid. Moreover, in modeling an initial flow discontinuity there are sub-grid-scale oscillations in the particle velocity field in the neighborhood of the discontinuity. These difficulties are eliminated using the mass matrix. In addition, the mass matrix formulation conserves kinetic energy, linear and angular momentum, and is Galilean invariant.}

In this study, different calibration strategies of the SEDD model were explored to adapt its use in two olive catchments with different environmental features and managements. A data series of rainfall{\textendash}runoff{\textendash}sediment load, collected in the catchments for 6 years was used: i) to evaluate calibration strategies for different management and flow conditions through the analysis of the C and R factors, and ii) to describe the temporal patterns of sediment delivery ratio (SDR) at the event and annual scales. Different results and calibration approaches were derived from contrasting soil features and sediment dynamics in the catchments. A good model performance with simple calibration procedure was obtained for the catchment with clayey soil and a very active gully, whereas the model parameterisation was adapted to event features in the catchment with sandy soil where the importance of concentrated flow was minor. Mean annual values of SDR at the watershed scale (SDRw) were 110.1\% for the catchment with clayey soil and 64.1\% for that with sandy soils. SDRw values greater than 100\% occurred in very humid years with precipitations 30\% above the mean annual values. At the event scale, similar behaviours of SDR were observed. SDR{$>$}100\% were associated with the gully exporting sediments out from the clayey catchment, whereas this was done by rills and an ephemeral gully in the sandy catchment.},

The traditional tridiagonal scheme is rewritten as a sum of two bidiagonal schemes in order to produce a simpler method better suited for unsteady transcritical flows. On the other hand, the origin of the instabilities associated to the use of upwind implicit methods for shock propagations is identified and a new stability condition for non-linear problems is proposed. This modification produces a robust, simple and accurate upwind semi-explicit scheme suitable for discontinuous flows with high Courant{\textendash}Friedrichs{\textendash}Lewy (CFL) numbers. The discretization at the boundaries is based on the condition of global mass conservation thus enabling a fully conservative solution for all kind of boundary conditions. The performance of the proposed technique will be shown in the solution of the inviscid Burgers' equation, in an ideal dambreak test case, in some steady open channel flow test cases with analytical solution and in a realistic flood routing problem, where stable and accurate solutions will be presented using CFL values up to 100.

This review mainly covers artificial-intelligence approaches to RL, from the viewpoint of the control engineer. We explain how approximate representations of the solution make RL feasible for problems with continuous states and control actions. Stability is a central concern in control, and we argue that while the control-theoretic RL subfield called adaptive dynamic programming is dedicated to it, stability of RL largely remains an open question. We also cover in detail the case where deep neural networks are used for approximation, leading to the field of deep RL, which has shown great success in recent years. With the control practitioner in mind, we outline opportunities and pitfalls of deep RL; and we close the survey with an outlook that {\textendash} among other things {\textendash} points out some avenues for bridging the gap between control and artificial-intelligence RL techniques.},

  abstract = {The Trinity River in northern California was adjusting to unregulated flood and mining impacts when it was dammed and flow regulation began in 1960. We examine the subsequent evolution of the river's alluvial channel through 60 years of increases in regulated mainstem flow regimes in an unconfined and confined valley where Rush and Indian creeks respectively join the river 6.9 and 26.7 river kilometres from Lewiston Dam. The resulting capacity of the tributary junctions for rearing Chinook salmon fry in the current flow regime is evaluated with an empirical model developed for the Trinity River. Results indicate that morphologic changes at Indian Creek were relatively minor after damming because mainstem flows were restricted to a narrow channel in comparison to the channel at Rush Creek. Conversely, active channel and bar areas significantly declined at Rush Creek because the mainstem sediment supply was more severely reduced by flow regulation that enabled riparian vegetation to colonize the expansive alluvial surfaces that were present. These changes reduced instream habitat, suggesting salmon populations in large valleys may be at higher risk below dams than in smaller valleys where the reduced flow is confined to an already narrow channel. However, the relatively wide and unconfined valley responded more positively to increases in flow and sediment through the regulatory periods to yield significantly higher capacities for rearing Chinook fry. Therefore, while unconfined reaches may be particularly susceptible to change when a river is dammed, they may also provide the greatest opportunity for restoration of salmon populations.},

  abstract = {Reach-scale morphological channel classifications are underpinned by the theory that each channel type is related to an assemblage of reach- and catchment-scale hydrologic, topographic, and sediment supply drivers. However, the relative importance of each driver on reach morphology is unclear, as is the possibility that different driver assemblages yield the same reach morphology. Reach-scale classifications have never needed to be predicated on hydrology, yet hydrology controls discharge and thus sediment transport capacity. The scientific question is: do two or more regions with quantifiable differences in hydrologic setting end up with different reach-scale channel types, or do channel types transcend hydrologic setting because hydrologic setting is not a dominant control at the reach scale? This study answered this question by isolating hydrologic metrics as potential dominant controls of channel type. Three steps were applied in a large test basin with diverse hydrologic settings (Sacramento River, California) to: (1) create a reach-scale channel classification based on local site surveys, (2) categorize sites by flood magnitude, dimensionless flood magnitude, and annual hydrologic regime type, and (3) statistically analyze two hydrogeomorphic linkages. Statistical tests assessed the spatial distribution of channel types and the dependence of channel type morphological attributes by hydrologic setting. Results yielded 10 channel types. Nearly all types existed across all hydrologic settings, which is perhaps a surprising development for hydrogeomorphology. Downstream hydraulic geometry relationships were statistically significant. In addition, cobble-dominated uniform streams showed a consistent inverse relationship between slope and dimensionless flood magnitude, an indication of dynamic equilibrium between transport capacity and sediment supply. However, most morphological attributes showed no sorting by hydrologic setting. This study suggests that median hydraulic geometry relations persist across basins and within channel types, but hydrologic influence on geomorphic variability is likely due to local influences rather than catchment-scale drivers. {\textcopyright} 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

MT3DMS interfaces directly with the U.S. Geological Survey finite-difference groundwater flow model MODFLOW for the flow solution and supports the hydrologic and discretization features of MODFLOW. MT3DMS contains multiple transport solution techniques in one code, which can often be important, including in model calibration. Since its first release in 1990 as MT3D for single-species mass transport modeling, MT3DMS has been widely used in research projects and practical field applications. This article provides a brief introduction to MT3DMS and presents recommendations about calibration and validation procedures for field applications of MT3DMS. The examples presented suggest the need to consider alternative processes as models are calibrated and suggest opportunities and difficulties associated with using groundwater age in transport model calibration.},

Bayesian Monte Carlo for evaluation of uncertainty in hydrodynamic models of coastal systems.Uncertainty analysis constitutes the set of procedures and strategies conducted to identify, quantify, and report the impacts of different sources of errors on the predictions of a numerical model. Although during the last couple of decades several investigations in different areas of water resources have explicitly discussed the importance of a new modeling paradigm where model predictions are reported along with uncertainty estimates, uncertainty analysis remains an emerging topic in the field of hydrodynamic modeling. Presently, several unresolved issues remain with regard to the applicability, benefits, and limitations of existing strategies for quantification of uncertainty, and the identification of the principal sources of uncertainty in practical applications.In this document we apply the Bayesian Monte Carlo (BMC) method as a strategy to perform uncertainty analysis in coastal modeling studies. BMC is based on robust principles of Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo simulations, and has been successfully applied for studies of groundwater modeling, hydrologic modeling, and water quality modeling in the past. The procedural aspects of the method are discussed in detail, and the implementation of the method is demonstrated for the hydrodynamic model of the St. Louis Bay estuary, Mississippi (USA) for the evaluation of the impacts of input data errors. Results indicate that BMC is an effective strategy for uncertainty analyses, although in professional practice its use may be limited by computational requirements. We also point out that the effectiveness of the method may be affected by the correct selection of the likelihood function and the model error variance.}

Ultrasound velocity profilers were used to measure the horizontal velocity components across the entire reservoir surface, allowing for the visualization of streamlines and of the instantaneous and average velocities. Five different types of flow patterns were identified, depending on the values of the length-to-width ratio and expansion ratio of the reservoir. Asymmetrical flow patterns were found to develop for certain combinations of these geometric parameters despite the perfect reservoir symmetry.

  abstract = {The structure and function of rivers have long been characterized either by: (1) qualitative models such as the River Continuum Concept or Serial Discontinuity Concept which paint broad descriptive portraits of how river habitats and communities vary, or (2) quantitative models, such as downstream hydraulic geometry, which rely on a limited number of measurements spread widely throughout a river basin. In contrast, authors such as Fausch et al. (2002) and Wiens (2002) proposed applying existing quantitative, spatially comprehensive ecology and landscape ecology methods to rivers. This new framework for river sciences which preserves variability and spatial relationships is called a riverine landscape or a {\dbend}riverscape{\dbend}. Application of this riverscape concept requires information on the spatial distribution of organism-scale habitats throughout entire river systems. This article examines the ways in which recent technical and methodological developments can allow us to quantitatively implement and realize the riverscape concept. Using 3-cm true color aerial photos and 5-m resolution elevation data from the River Tromie, Scotland, we apply the newly developed Fluvial Information System which integrates a suite of cutting edge, high resolution, remote sensing methods in a spatially explicit framework. This new integrated approach allows for the extraction of primary fluvial variables such as width, depth, particle size, and elevation. From these first-order variables, we derive second-order geomorphic and hydraulic variables including velocity, stream power, Froude number and shear stress. Channel slope can be approximated from available topographic data. Based on these first and second-order variables, we produce riverscape metrics that begin to explore how geomorphic structures may influence river habitats, including connectivity, patchiness of habitat, and habitat distributions. The results show a complex interplay of geomorphic variable and habitat patchiness that is not predicted by existing fluvial theory. Riverscapes, thus, challenge the existing understanding of how rivers structure themselves and will force development of new paradigms.},

  abstract = {Measurement of riverbed material grain sizes is now a routine part of fieldwork in fluvial geomorphology and lotic ecology. In the last decade, several authors have proposed remote sensing approaches of grain size measurements based on terrestrial and aerial imagery. Given the current rise of small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) applications in geomorphology, there is now increasing interest in the application of these remotely sensed grain size mapping methods to sUAS imagery. However, success in this area has been limited owing to two fundamental problems: lack of constraint of image scale for sUAS imagery and blurring effects in sUAS images and resulting orthomosaics. In this work, we solve the former by showing that SfM-photogrammetry can be used in a direct georeferencing (DG) workflow (i.e. with no ground validation) in order to predict image scale within margins of 3\%. We then propose a novel approach of robotic photosieving of dry exposed riverbed grains that relies on near-ground images acquired from a low-cost sUAS and which does not require the presence of ground control points or visible scale objects. We demonstrate that this absence of scale objects does not affect photosieving outputs thus resulting in a low-cost and efficient sampling method for surficial grains.

Two models for predicting horizontal fluid flux through the hyporheic zone, one based solely on valley slope and another that uses both valley slope and channel sinuosity, are presented in this article. Both models require knowledge of aquifer hydraulic conductivity. The models are developed via a suite of groundwater flow simulations with boundary conditions taking a variety of channel geometries, idealized as sinusoidal, and valley slopes that we assume are similar to that of the water table. Functional predictive models are developed by fitting a line or surface to discrete model output which covers the spectrum of most natural meandering rivers. Since the fitted models only require channel slope and/or sinuosity (plus hydraulic conductivity), they are amenable for regional estimation of hyporheic flux using digital terrain data.},

These papers have proved controversial, in part because of a lack of direct evidence for a mechanism to explain the phenomenon. Now, in experiments involving manipulation of the number of algal species in model stream systems, Bradley Cardinale provides one such mechanism. Uptake of nitrogen nutrients increased linearly with species richness in response to changes in flow habitats and disturbance regimes. But when niche structure was experimentally removed, the relationship disappeared. This suggests that habitats with more species take greater advantage of the niche opportunities in an environment than do less-species-rich habitats, allowing the more diverse systems to capture a greater fraction of biologically active resources such as nitrogen.},

  abstract = {Structure from motion (SfM) has seen rapid uptake recently in the fluvial and aquatic sciences. This uptake is not least due to the widespread availability of cheap unmanned aerial vehicles/drones, which help mitigate the challenging terrain and deliver efficient and reproducible and high-accuracy images and topographical data. These data can have unprecedented spatio-temporal coverage and includes measurements of fluvial and aquatic topography, hydraulics, geomorphology and habitat quality. SfM data also offer novel quantification of underwater archeology, structures and aquatic organisms. Studies are shifting from proof-of-concepts in topographic survey to genuine applications including grain-size mapping, bathymetric surveys, geomorphological mapping, vegetation mapping, restoration monitoring, habitat classification, geomorphological change detection and sediment transport path delineation. Integrating point cloud analyses and orthophoto mosaics with digital elevation models has been shown to be effective in providing novel process understanding of fluvial and aquatic systems. Underwater and through-water studies are beginning to overcome problems of accessibility, visibility and image distortion. Archival photographs and video (both above- and under-water) are being reprocessed using a SfM workflow to generate three-dimensional surfaces and objects from historical surveys, thereby extending the time period over which change can be detected. Recently, a SfM workflow has been developed to model free water surfaces with clear potential for future exploitation in hydraulics, sediment transport and river bed evolution studies. Future applications of SfM could seek to exploit the daily repeat coverage of high-resolution satellite images but must be mindful of the necessary investment in this development versus the increasing availability and coverage of spaceborne light detection and ranging.

  abstract = {European legislation is driving the development of methods for river ecosystem protection in light of concerns over water quality and ecology. Key to their success is the accurate and rapid characterisation of physical features (i.e., hydromorphology) along the river. Image pattern recognition techniques have been successfully used for this purpose. The reliability of the methodology depends on both the quality of the aerial imagery  and the pattern recognition technique used. Recent studies have proved the potential of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to increase the quality of the imagery by capturing high resolution photography. Similarly, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been shown to be a high precision tool for automated recognition of environmental patterns. This paper presents a UAV based framework for the identification of hydromorphological features from high resolution RGB aerial imagery using a novel classification technique based on ANNs. The framework is developed for a 1.4 km river reach along the river Dee in Wales, United Kingdom. For this purpose, a Falcon 8 octocopter was used to gather  2.5 cm resolution imagery. The results show that the accuracy of the framework is above 81\%, performing particularly well at recognising vegetation. These results leverage the use of UAVs for environmental policy implementation and demonstrate the potential of ANNs and RGB imagery for high precision river monitoring and river management.},

  abstract = {The multiple protocols that have been developed to characterize river hydromorphology, partly in response to legislative drivers such as the European Union Water Framework Directive (EU WFD), make the comparison of results obtained in different countries challenging. Recent studies have analyzed the comparability of existing methods, with remote sensing based approaches being proposed as a potential means of harmonizing hydromorphological characterization protocols. However, the resolution achieved by remote sensing products may not be sufficient to assess some of the key hydromorphological features that are required to allow an accurate characterization. Methodologies based on high resolution aerial photography taken from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been proposed by several authors as potential approaches to overcome these limitations. Here, we explore the applicability of an existing UAV based framework for hydromorphological characterization to three different fluvial settings representing some of the distinct ecoregions defined by the WFD geographical intercalibration groups (GIGs). The framework is based on the automated recognition of hydromorphological features via tested and validated Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Results show that the framework is transferable to the Central-Baltic and Mediterranean GIGs with accuracies in feature identification above 70\%. Accuracies of 50\% are achieved when the framework is implemented in the Very Large Rivers GIG. The framework successfully identified vegetation, deep water, shallow water, riffles, side bars and shadows for the majority of the reaches. However, further algorithm development is required to ensure a wider range of features (e.g., chutes, structures and erosion) are accurately identified. This study also highlights the need to develop an objective and fit for purpose hydromorphological characterization framework to be adopted within all EU member states to facilitate comparison of results.},

Sediments also block intakes in reservoirs and damage tunnels and turbines. The use of models to simulate reservoir sedimentation enables the key parameters of reservoir life to be predicted over the long term. In particular, they can provide information on the distribution of sediments within a reservoir; a key issue for the project's lifetime and the planning of management measures. The rate of reservoir sedimentation depends mainly on the size of a reservoir relative to the amount of sediment flowing into it: a small reservoir on an extremely muddy river will rapidly lose capacity; a large reservoir on a very clear river may take centuries to lose an appreciable amount of storage. To predict sedimentation rate with reasonable accuracy involves the estimation of trap efficiency of a reservoir. Different methods of estimation of the reservoir trap efficiency are discussed.},

There are research and management needs for evaluation of the effectiveness of rehabilitation projects intended to enhance stream fish habitat recovery. The response of populations of juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and steelhead O. mykiss to addition of large woody debris (LWD) was tested in North Fork Porter Creek (NFPC), a small coastal tributary of the Chehalis River, Washington. The NFPC was divided into three 500-m study sections; two sections were altered with two approaches (engineered and logger's choice) to adding LWD, and the third was kept as a reference site. Immediately after LWD addition, the abundance of LWD pieces was 7.9 times greater than the pretreatment level in the engineered site and 2.7 times greater in the logger's choice site; abundance was unchanged in the reference site. Subsequent winter storms brought additional LWD into all three study sites. In the years that followed, the amount of pool surface area increased significantly in both the engineered and logger's choice sites, while it decreased slightly in the reference site. After LWD addition, winter populations of juvenile coho salmon increased significantly in the engineered and logger's choice sites, while they remained the same in the reference site. There were no significant differences in the coho salmon populations during spring and autumn within the reference, engineered, or logger's choice sites. The coho salmon smolt yield from the engineered and logger's choice sites also increased significantly after LWD addition, while it decreased slightly in the reference site. After LWD addition, the reference site and the engineered site both exhibited increases in age-0 steelhead populations; however, the population in the logger's choice site did not change. There was no difference in age-1 steelhead abundance among sites, or before and after enhancement during any season. Winter populations of juvenile coho salmon and age-0 steelhead were related inversely to maximum and mean winter discharge.},

  abstract = {Land cover, the physical state of the earth's surface and immediate subsurface, and land use, the human employment on that land, were long studied with a distinct focus on either geographic variables employing spatially explicit models or on the analysis of econometric models employing `conventional, i.e. non-spatial, models. In the past few years, researchers increasingly attempt to link geographic variables and socioeconomic indicators. Recent spatially explicit studies of the determinants of land-cover and land-use changes integrate geo- and biophysical data with socioeconomic variables derived from quantitative surveys or censuses. This paper has highlighted recent and innovative methods and results that integrate observations and modelling analyses of regional to global aspect of biophysical and biogeochemical interactions of land-cover change with the climate system. To date, cooperation between these communities has been limited. Based on common interests, this paper discusses research priorities in representing land use and land-cover change in Albania for improved collaboration across modelling, observing and measurement communities. Major research topics in land use and land-cover change are those that help us better understand [1] the interaction of land use and land cover with the climate system, [2]. the provision of goods and ecosystem services by terrestrial land-cover types, a n d [3] land use and management decisions.},

  abstract = {The quantification of microplastics is a challenging task to the scientific community, especially as the existing analytical methods limit sample numbers due to difficulties associated with high expenses and time consuming procedures. Quantifying microplastics by staining with Nile Red can be helpful in distinguishing these particles from other inorganic (e.g. sediment) or organic (e.g. plant material) matter. In the present study, the benefits of acetone, chloroform and nhexane as extraction solvents for Nile Red staining were investigated. For this study, various polymer types, namely highdensity and low-density polyethylene (HDPE, LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamide (PA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and cellulose acetate (CA), several post-consumer products (freezing bag, bottle cap, plastic bottle, styrofoam, fishing line, food container, pipe and cigarette butt) as well as biogenic material (algae, hard plant material, soft plant material) were used as test materials. Results indicated chloroform to be the most suitable solvent achieving recovery rates of 83.3\% for the group of HDPE, LDPE, PP and PVC being the most demanded polymer types in Europe. However, the proposed method does not reach the reliable quantification capabilities of Raman-spectroscopy or Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Nevertheless, it can aid the assessment of microplastic abundances. In conclusion, staining with Nile Red does not require expensive equipment and allows the quick evaluation of a large number of samples for the assessment of microplastics.},

Not only does it reduce a reservoir׳s capacity but it also affects its outlet structures such as bottom outlets and powerhouse intakes. Sedimentation may also impoverish downstream ecosystems. For these reasons, several strategies for sediment management are being investigated and applied worldwide. Among these methods, venting of turbidity currents reaching the dam can be very beneficial and economical. This measure helps in preserving a certain continuity of sediment transport in rivers obstructed by dams. However, several practical but also theoretical challenges hamper this technique, rendering its use less common and its aspects relatively unknown. The present paper aims to gather the actual state-of-the-art concerning turbidity currents venting and to present an outlook for future development and research in this field.},

  abstract = {Sediment yield into reservoirs was underestimated during the design of dams in the past. As a result, today, reservoir sedimentation is endangering the sustainability of dams. Moreover, the obstruction of rivers hinders their capacity to transport sediments and causes the alteration of their morphology and ecosystems. The rate of sedimentation is expected to increase in the future due to climate change. Turbidity currents are one of the main processes transporting sediments into long and deep reservoirs during floods. They are capable of transporting suspended sediments from the plunge point at the delta to the dam. Hence, venting of turbidity currents through bottom outlets is an appealing solution to reduce reservoir sedimentation. Using a flume of 8.55 m length and 0.27 m width, venting was investigated experimentally and numerically. Governing parameters such as the bottom outlet's discharge, the timing of venting relatively to the arrival of the turbidity current at the dam, the duration of venting, the reservoir's bed slope as well as the outlet's dimensions and level were studied. The efficiency of venting corresponding to the amount of sediments evacuated by the water used from the reservoir could be highlighted by systematic tests. The efficiency of venting increased with steeper bed slopes since the turbidity current was less reflected at the dam. Therefore, venting should be applied from the very beginning of dam impoundment to keep the cone upstream of the outlets free of sediments and the steepest bed slope possible close to the dam. The effect of the venting degree -defined as the ratio between outflow and turbidity current discharges- on the efficiency of venting was systematically studied. For turbidity currents reaching the outlet on a horizontal bed in the experimental configuration, a venting degree of about 100\% resulted in the highest venting efficiency. For steeper reservoir bed slopes (i.e., 2.4\% and 5.0\%), the optimum efficiency can be obtained with a venting degree of about 135\%. Venting was the most efficient when synchronized with the arrival of the turbidity current at the dam. Therefore, a gauging station should be placed around 300 m upstream of the low-level outlet to measure parameters such as velocity, indicating the arrival of the turbidity current. Furthermore, venting should last as long as there is inflow and should be maintained after the end of the flood for a duration that depends on the outflowing sediment concentration. In practice, venting can be stopped when the muddy lake has been evacuated and the vented water becomes clear again. This also allows cleaning the downstream river from fine sediment deposits after the venting operation. To optimize venting efficiency and minimize the dead storage, the outlet should be positioned at the lowest level possible. In addition, the height and width of the bottom outlet's entrance should be chosen in a way to create an aspiration cone that corresponds approximately to the dimensions of the body of the turbidity current. In order to keep the size of the low-level outlet reasonable, multiple outlets can be used to create the required aspiration cone},

Bayesian inference provides a methodology for estimation and uncertainty quantification of unknown model parameters. In our previous work, we developed parallel tempering Bayeslands as a framework for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for the Badlands landscape evolution model. Parallel tempering Bayeslands features high-performance computing that can feature dozens of processing cores running in parallel to enhance computational efficiency. Nevertheless, the procedure remains computationally challenging since thousands of samples need to be drawn and evaluated. In large-scale landscape evolution problems, a single model evaluation can take from several minutes to hours and in some instances, even days or weeks. Surrogate-assisted optimization has been used for several computationally expensive engineering problems which motivate its use in optimization and inference of complex geoscientific models. The use of surrogate models can speed up parallel tempering Bayeslands by developing computationally inexpensive models to mimic expensive ones. In this paper, we apply surrogate-assisted parallel tempering where the surrogate mimics a landscape evolution model by estimating the likelihood function from the model. We employ a neural-network-based surrogate model that learns from the history of samples generated. The entire framework is developed in a parallel computing infrastructure to take advantage of parallelism. The results show that the proposed methodology is effective in lowering the computational cost significantly while retaining the quality of model predictions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This model, which is for alluvial streams with nonerodible banks, may be employed to simulate stream bed changes during a given flow, thereby providing the necessary information for the design of dikes, levees, or other bank protection. This model incorporates the major effects of transverse circulation, inherent in curved channels, on the flow and sediment processes. In the simulation of the evolution in stream bed profile, the effect of transverse flow is tied in with the aggradation and degradation development. River flow through curved channels is characterized by the changing curvature, to which variations of flow pattern and bed topography are closely related. Simulation of these changing features is based upon the fluid dynamics governing the growth and decay of transverse circulation along the channel.},

  abstract = {A plan was made to remove Matilija Dam on the Ventura River. With dam removal, the delta in the reservoir and the downstream channel were expected to undergo major changes in morphology. The FLUVIAL-12 model was employed to simulate reservoir and river channel responses after dam removal. As a first step, the model was calibrated using the Ventura River data to establish its validity. In calibration, the model was used to simulate the fluvial processes starting from the time of dam completion. The simulated sediment deposition above the Matilija Dam matches closely with the deposits measured by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. A large amount of sediment was stored in the reservoir; some of the stored sediment would be transported downstream after dam removal. An important consequence of dam removal is the major increase of sediment release to the river channel downstream. The sediment supply to the downstream reach is not only from the stored sediment in the reservoir but also from natural sediment inflow from the upstream watershed. Therefore, sediment supply to the downstream reach will exceed the natural sediment flow before the dam presence. This situation tends to overload the downstream reach with sediment, resulting in excessive deposition. The amount of sediment release from the area above the removed dam is closely related to the changes in reservoir morphology. It is necessary to model changes in the channel bed profile and channel width during erosion in order to determine the amount of sediment removal. The amount of sediment release may not be simulated using an erodible-bed model but it may be determined using an erodible boundary model.},

For large rivers, it remains difficult to evaluate restoration efficiency and sustainability due to the lack of standardized monitoring metrics. From 2010 to 2016, three gravel augmentations were performed on the Old Rhine, a by-passed reach downstream from the Kembs dam (France- Germany). A geomorphic monitoring combining topo-bathymetric surveys, bedload tracking and hydraulic modelling allows to evaluate the successfulness of these actions. Results show that, to be mobilized, artificial sediment deposit should be located in concavity rather than convexity areas, due to higher shear stresses for moderate floods (Q2). Sediment starvation appeared rapidly on the restored reaches once the sediment wave moved downstream, as a consequence of limited upstream sediment supply. Bathymetric homogenization was observed along and downstream from the restored reaches without creation of new fluvial forms. This research highlights that future actions should include channel enlargement downstream of gravel augmentations, which would promote sediment deposition and habitat diversification. Sediments excavated during artificial widening could be stored and injected progressively into the upstream part of the Old Rhine to benefit the downstream sections.},

  abstract = {Quantitative models of landform development can help us to understand the evolution of mountains and regional topography, and the effects of tectonic motions and climate on landscape, including its fractal geometry. This paper presents a general and powerful three-dimensional model of fluvial erosion and deposition at hill- to mountain-range scale. The model works by accumulating the effects of randomly seeded storms or floods (precipitons) that cause diffusional smoothing then move downslope on digital topography grids, that erode portions of elevation differences, that transport a slope-limited amount of eroded material, and that deposit alluvium when their sediment-carrying capacity is exceeded. The iteration of these simple and almost linear rules produce very complicated simulated landscapes, demonstrating that complex landscapes do not require complex laws. Each process implemented in the model is affected differently by changes in horizontal scale. Erosion, a scale-free process, roughens topography at all wavelengths. This roughening is balanced by diffusive processes (scaling as 1L2) at short wavelengths and deposition (scaling (scaling as 1L2) at long wavelenghts. Such a mixture of scale-free and scale-dependent processes can produce multifractal behavior in the models. The fractal dimension of the model topography is much more sensitive to climatic variables than to tectonic uplift. Landscape evolution may be fractal, but it does not seem to be chaotic. Analysis of topography of areas in southern Arizona using variograms shows approximately fractal behavior, with mean fractal dimension around 2.2{\dbend}2.3. Departures from an exact fractal relatioship imply that the topography is in detail multifractal. The fractal dimension at short wavelengths is less than that at long wavelengths. This variation could either be caused by the relative strengths of diffusive and erosional processes shaping the topography, or a result of changes in climatic or tectonic conditions still preserved in the landscape.},

  abstract = {The hydrostatic pressure assumption has been widely used in studying water movements in shallow waters where the water depth (D) is much smaller than the horizontal length scale (L). It is assumed that the pressure field in a shallow water flow is hydrostatic because the nonhydrostatic pressure component (pn) is much smaller than the hydrostatic pressure component (ph) and thus be safely neglected in model simulations. With this assumption, a three-dimensional, hydrodynamic model can be significantly simplified because the momentum equation in the vertical direction is reduced to an expression of hydrostatic pressure. While such a simplification is valid in many shallow water applications, there exist no rigorous guidelines as to what extent can the hydrostatic assumption be safely used without any problems. In an effort to get a better understanding of the effect of nonhydrostatic pressure on free-surface flow, this paper presents a comparison of hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic pressure components and their horizontal gradients in two seiches. The first seiche represents a deepwater wave oscillation, while the second one is a shallow water wave oscillation. A nonhydrostatic model was used to simulate the two oscillations, and simulated hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic pressure components were compared. A scale analysis was also carried out for the two pressure components in seiching. It is found that although the nonhydrostatic component was about 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the hydrostatic component for the two oscillations, the horizontal gradient of the nonhydrostatic component is not necessarily smaller than that of hydrostatic pressure by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. On the other hand, while the horizontal gradient of nonhydrostatic pressure may be in the same order of magnitude as that of hydrostatic pressure, it does not necessarily require nonhydrostatic pressure itself to be in the same order of magnitude as hydrostatic pressure. Model simulations also show that the nonhydrostatic portion of the horizontal pressure gradient affects the velocity field during the course of the oscillation and its effects are not negligible even when the aspect ratio is less than 0.05.},

  abstract = {Widening in sinuous channels occurs when the retreat of the outer bank exceeds the advance of the opposite bank. An analytical model is presented to simulate width adjustment in meandering channels of non-cohesive bank material resulting from bank erosion of two interactive processes: basal erosion and bank collapse. Bank collapse refers to the avalanche of noncohesive material in the upper part of bank above water surface resulting from over-steepening of the bank surface due to basal erosion. The rate of basal erosion, including lateral erosion and bed degradation, is calculated as a function of the longitudinal gradient of sediment transport rate and strength of secondary flow. The transverse bed slope is treated as a variable that increases as channel sinuosity increases until the transverse bed slope reaches its maximum value. By simplifying the bankcollapse process for non-cohesive materials, the present study shows that the rate of bank-line retreat is determined by lateral erosion rate, near-bank bed-degradation rate, sediment grain size, and difference between flow depth and bank height. The timedependent widening processes of two meandering channels in the laboratory are selected to test applicability of the model. The result shows that the simulated bank lines at individual time intervals closely match the experimental measurements. Whether the sinuosity of a meandering channel will increase or decrease is primarily determined by didtribution of the lngitudinal gradient of sediment transport rate along the channel.},

  abstract = {{$<$}section class="abstract"{$><$}h2 class="abstractTitle text-title my-1" id="d40986643e71"{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}The interpretation of model precipitation output (e.g., as a gridpoint estimate versus as an areal mean) has a large impact on the evaluation and comparison of simulated daily extreme rainfall indices from climate models. It is first argued that interpretation as a gridpoint estimate (i.e., corresponding to station data) is incorrect. The impacts of this interpretation versus the areal mean interpretation in the context of rainfall extremes are then illustrated. A high-resolution (0.25{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 0.25{\textdegree} grid) daily observed precipitation dataset for the United States [from Climate Prediction Center (CPC)] is used as idealized perfect model gridded data. Both 30-yr return levels of daily precipitation ({$<$}em{$>$}P{$<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{30}) and a simple daily intensity index are substantially reduced in these data when estimated at coarser resolution compared to the estimation at finer resolution. The reduction of {$<$}em{$>$}P{$<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{30} averaged over the conterminous United States is about 9\%, 15\%, 28\%, 33\%, and 43\% when the data were first interpolated to 0.5{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 0.5{\textdegree}, 1{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 1{\textdegree}, 2{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 2{\textdegree}, 3{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 3{\textdegree}, and 4{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 4{\textdegree} grid boxes, respectively, before the calculation of extremes. The differences resulting from the point estimate versus areal mean interpretation are sensitive to both the data grid size and to the particular extreme rainfall index analyzed. The differences are not as sensitive to the magnitude and regional distribution of the indices. Almost all Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) models underestimate U.S. mean {$<$}em{$>$}P{$<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{30} if it is compared directly with {$<$}em{$>$}P{$<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{30} estimated from the high-resolution CPC daily rainfall observation. On the other hand, if CPC daily data are first interpolated to various model resolutions before calculating the {$<$}em{$>$}P{$<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{30} (a more correct procedure in our view), about half of the models show good agreement with observations while most of the remaining models tend to overestimate the mean intensity of heavy rainfall events. A further implication of interpreting model precipitation output as an areal mean is that use of either simple multimodel ensemble averages of extreme rainfall or of intermodel variability measures of extreme rainfall to assess the common characteristics and range of uncertainties in current climate models is not appropriate if simulated extreme rainfall is analyzed at a model's native resolution. Owing to the large sensitivity to the assumption used, the authors recommend that for analysis of precipitation extremes, investigators interpret model precipitation output as an area average as opposed to a point estimate and then ensure that various analysis steps remain consistent with that interpretation.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Model results showed a general increase in soil erosion and deposition volume under the A1B-S climate change scenario. The situation is even worsened with increasing return periods. Total erosion volume and total sediment yield in the watershed were increased by 4{\textendash}25\% and 8{\textendash}65\%, respectively, and deposition volumes increased by 2{\textendash}23\%. The study showed how climate change variability would influence the watershed through increased sediment yields, which might even worsen the impacts of natural disasters.

  abstract = {Sediment transport to river channels in a basin is of great significance for a variety of reasons ranging from soil preservation to siltation prevention of reservoirs. Among the commonly used models of sediment transport, the SEdiment Delivery Distributed model (SEDD) uses an exponential function to model the likelihood of eroded soils reaching the rivers and denotes the probability as the Sediment Delivery Ratio of morphological unit i (SDRi). The use of probability to model SDRi in SEDD led us to examine the model and check for its statistical validity. As a result, we found that the SEDD model had several false assertions and needs to be revised to correct for the discrepancies with the statistical properties of the exponential distributions. The results of our study are presented here. We propose an alternative model, the Revised SEDD (RSEDD) model, to better estimate SDRi. We also show how to calibrate the model parameters and examine an example watershed to see if the travel time of sediments follows an exponential distribution. Finally, we reviewed studies citing the SEDD model to explore if they would be impacted by switching to the proposed RSEDD model.},

  abstract = {Influenced by climate change and human activities, especially the completion and operation of cascade reservoirs in the middle and lower reaches of Jinsha River since 2012, new changes have taken place in the water and sediment characteristics of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in recent years. In this paper, a one-dimensional unsteady water and sediment mathematical model of the main and tributary rivers of the TGR is established, and the main calculation parameters of the model are calibrated with the measured water and sediment data from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017. In view of the different combinations of inflow water and sediment that may occur in the TGR under the condition of new water and sediment, the long-term changes of sediment erosion and deposition and the balance of reservoir deposition in the TGR are studied using the model. The results show that: (1) Under the new conditions of water and sediment, the amount of sediment in the TGR accounts for only 14.8\% and 35.8\% of that in 1956{\textendash}1990 and 2003{\textendash}2012, respectively; (2) The variation process of water level, discharge and sediment concentration of each station along the route calculated by the model is basically consistent with the measured results, and the calculated values of total deposition amount and deposition distribution are also basically consistent with the measured results. The verification results of the model are in accordance with the measured values; (3) Under the water-sediment conditions during 1961{\textendash}1970 and 1991{\textendash}2000, the model predicted the estimates of 320 and 430 years for the TGR to reach a sedimentation balance, respectively. Under the new water-sediment conditions, it takes 560 years at most and 450 years at least to reach the sedimentation balance for the TGR, and the corresponding condition is the typical year with less water-less sediment and more water-more sediment, respectively. The research results of this paper can provide a new reference for the long-term safe operation and operation optimization of the TGR.},

The automatic calibration of the model consists of two parts: water balance parameter and runoff routing parameter calibration. The former is based on a simple genetic algorithm (GA). The latter is based on a new method which combines a fuzzy optimal model (FOM) with a GA for solving the multiple objective runoff routing parameters calibration problem. Except for the specific fitness where the membership degree of alternative obtained by FOM with limited alternatives and multiobjectives is employed, the GA with multiple objectives in this paper is otherwise the same as the simple GA. The parameter calibration includes optimization of multiple objectives: (1) peak discharge, (2) peak time and (3) total runoff volume. Thirtyfour historical floods from 12 years in the Shuangpai Reservoir are applied to calibrate the model parameters whilst 11 floods in recent 2 years are utilized to verify these parameters. Results of this study and application show that the hybrid methodology of GAs and the FOM is not only capable of exploiting more the important characteristics of floods but also efficient and robust. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {This paper presents a fast incompressible SPH (ISPH) solver implemented to run entirely on a graphics processing unit (GPU) capable of simulating several millions of particles in three dimensions on a single GPU. The ISPH algorithm is implemented by converting the highly optimised open-source weakly-compressible SPH (WCSPH) code DualSPHysics to run ISPH on the GPU, combining it with the open-source linear algebra library ViennaCL for fast solutions of the pressure Poisson equation (PPE). Several challenges are addressed with this research: constructing a PPE matrix every timestep on the GPU for moving particles, optimising the limited GPU memory, and exploiting fast matrix solvers. The ISPH pressure projection algorithm is implemented as 4 separate stages, each with a particle sweep, including an algorithm for the population of the PPE matrix suitable for the GPU, and mixed precision storage methods. An accurate and robust ISPH boundary condition ideal for parallel processing is also established by adapting an existing WCSPH boundary condition for ISPH. A variety of validation cases are presented: an impulsively started plate, incompressible flow around a moving square in a box, and dambreaks (2-D and 3-D) which demonstrate the accuracy, flexibility, and speed of the methodology. Fragmentation of the free surface is shown to influence the performance of matrix preconditioners and therefore the PPE matrix solution time. The Jacobi preconditioner demonstrates robustness and reliability in the presence of fragmented flows. For a dambreak simulation, GPU speed ups demonstrate up to 10{\textendash}18 times and 1.1{\textendash}4.5 times compared to single-threaded and 16-threaded CPU run times respectively.},

  abstract = {This study determines the aspects of river bathymetry that have the greatest influence on the predictive biases when simulating hyporheic exchange. To investigate this, we build a highly parameterized HydroGeoSphere model of the Steinlach River Test Site in southwest Germany as a reference. This model is then modified with simpler bathymetries, evaluating the changes to hyporheic exchange fluxes and transit time distributions. Results indicate that simulating hyporheic exchange with a high-resolution detailed bathymetry using a three-dimensional fully coupled model leads to nested multiscale hyporheic exchange systems. A poorly resolved bathymetry will underestimate the small-scale hyporheic exchange, biasing the simulated hyporheic exchange towards larger scales, thus leading to overestimates of hyporheic exchange residence times. This can lead to gross biases in the estimation of a catchment's capacity to attenuate pollutants when extrapolated to account for all meanders along an entire river within a watershed. The detailed river slope alone is not enough to accurately simulate the locations and magnitudes of losing and gaining river reaches. Thus, local bedforms in terms of bathymetric highs and lows within the river are required. Bathymetry surveying campaigns can be more effective by prioritizing bathymetry measurements along the thalweg and gegenweg of a meandering channel. We define the gegenweg as the line that connects the shallowest points in successive cross-sections along a river opposite to the thalweg under average flow conditions. Incorporating local bedforms will likely capture the nested nature of hyporheic exchange, leading to more physically meaningful simulations of hyporheic exchange fluxes and transit times.},

PSO does not need any initial guess of each parameter and thus avoids the subjective estimation usually found in traditional estimation methods and reduces the likelihood of finding a local optimum of the parameter values.

  abstract = {Turbulence transportation across permeable interfaces is investigated using direct numerical simulation, and the connection between the turbulent surface flow and the pore flow is explored. The porous media domain is constructed with an in-line arranged circular cylinder array. The effects of Reynolds number and porosity are also investigated by comparing cases with two Reynolds numbers (\$\$Re{\textbackslash}approx 3000,6000\$\$) and two porosities (\$\${\textbackslash}varphi =0.5,0.8\$\$). It was found that the change of porosity leads to the variation of flow motions near the interface region, which further affect turbulence transportation below the interface. The turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget shows that turbulent diffusion and pressure transportation work as energy sink and source alternatively, which suggests a possible route for turbulence transferring into porous region. Further analysis on the spectral TKE budget reveals the role of modes of different wavelengths. A major finding is that mean convection not only affects the distribution of TKE in spatial space, but also in scale space. The permeability of the wall also have an major impact on the occurrence ratio between blow and suction events as well as their corresponding flow structures, which can be related to the change of the K{\'a}rm{\'a}n constant of the mean velocity profile.},

This study aimed to estimate average annual soil erosion in terms of spatial distribution and sediment deposition by using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and GIS techniques. This study also applied remote sensing and available data sources for soil erosion analysis. Annual soil erosion in most parts of the study area range from 700 to 10,000 t/km2/y with a mean value of 5350 t/km2/y. Approximately 45\% of the total area undergoes moderate erosion. Moreover, the assessments of sediment deposition and erosion using the modified RUSLE and the GIS techniques indicate high sediment erosion along the flow direction of the mainstream, from the upper Mekong River to the Mekong Delta. The northern part of the upper Mekong River and the central and southern parts of the lower Mekong River are the most vulnerable to the increase in soil erosion rates, indicating sediment deposition.},

Despite the ubiquitous use of turbidity (CT) as a barometer of water quality and environmental ``health'', CT modelling studies have been rare due to lack of detailed experimental data required for validation. This study explored the fate and transport of a turbid density flow entering a stratified reservoir (Daecheong Reservoir, Korea) through application of a coupled three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic and particle dynamics model and subsequent validation of the predictions against an extensive data-set collected during the flood season of 2004. The turbidity model simulated multiple size groups of suspended sediment (SS) and used site-specific SS{\textendash}CT relationships to convert between field measurements (CT) and model state variables (SS). The model showed good performance in reproducing the reservoir thermal structure, flood propagation dynamics and the magnitude and distribution of turbidity in the reservoir. The turbidity modelling framework developed in this study can be adopted within a real-time management system for forecasting of turbidity and to support adaptive control of withdrawal facilities in reservoirs that suffer from turbid flood runoff.},

  abstract = {The mobility of bed material is investigated in a small gravel bed river in which the bed is weakly bimodal in texture and relatively stable. The bed surface remained intact throughout the freshet, and scour was limited to small areas of the bed. Observations of bedload caught in pit traps and displacement of magnetically tagged particles during two spring freshets permit analysis of the mobility of each size fraction. Fractional transport rates plot up to three orders of magnitude below the reference transport rate suggested in the literature. At low flows, no size fraction was fully mobile. At intermediate flows (shear stress {$>$}27 Pa) sand was fully mobile while larger material remained partially mobile. At high flows ({$>$}43 Pa) the division between the full and partial mobility regimes occurred around 16 mm, which remains finer than the median size of the subsurface material. The largest material scarcely moves at mean annual flood. Magnetic tracers confirmed results obtained from the pit traps. Three distinct zones of mobility can be defined in fractional transport plots: partial mobility, full mobility, and overpassing/suspended. Critical shear stress for incipient motion varied over an order of magnitude; a qualitatively similar result for bimodal sediment was reported by Wilcock and McArdell [1993]. Incipient motion analysis based on the largest grain observed to move yielded an upper envelope implying transport similarity for sizes found on the bed surface, and a lower envelope that corresponds with our (nonsimilar) entrainment criterion.},

The goal of this study was to compare different methods of determining two parameters used to estimate streambank erosion, soil critical shear stress (tc) and soil erodibility (kd) and to determine the impact of those differences on predictions of streambank erosion. At 25 field sites, bank erosion tests were conducted using a submerged jet test device, and soil samples were collected. Critical shear stress was measured using a multi-angle submerged jet test device (JT) and estimated based on Shields' diagram (SD) and empirical relations based on the soil parameters, percent clay (Pc), plasticity index (Iw), particle size (D50) and percent silt-clay (SC). Additionally, using a single set of tc values, the kd measured by the jet test was compared to predictions from two empirical kd relations. Using these parameter values, streambank erosion rates were predicted for a local stream. The jet tc estimates were as much as four orders of magnitude greater than the SD, Pc, and D50 estimates, indicating the SD and empirical methods underestimate tc. The two empirical kd equations produced similar kd values that were generally two orders of magnitude less than the values from the jet test measurements. Erosion predictions followed the same trend as the kd data, with the jet test measurements resulting in higher predictions. Field validation of these methods over a wide range of soil types is recommended to develop methods of estimating kd and tc for fine-grained streambank soils.},

Here we present a hierarchical agglomeration algorithm for detecting community structure which is faster than many competing algorithms: its running time on a network with n vertices and m edges is O(mdlogn) where d is the depth of the dendrogram describing the community structure. Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m{$\sim$}n and d{$\sim$}logn, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(nlog2n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web site of a large on-line retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400 000 vertices and 2{\texttimes}106 edges. We show that our algorithm can extract meaningful communities from this network, revealing large-scale patterns present in the purchasing habits of customers.}

In order to perform water quality simulations in specific study areas, HSPF's hydrology must first be calibrated to observed streamflow data. PEST is a model-independent parameter optimization program which minimizes an ``objective function'' quantifying the misfit between model outputs and corresponding field measurements. PEST also performs nonlinear predictive confidence interval estimation in which PEST determines maximum and minimum limits on key model predictions. A PEST/HSPF Windows interface is being developed for incorporation in the BASINS GIS-based watershed and water quality modeling system. This study seeks to identify successful PEST/HSPF calibration protocols that successfully minimize key model predictions for incorporation in the interface design.},

  abstract = {Laboratory and field assessments were used to determine whether the construction of culverts affects brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) egg survival through the introduction of elevated sediment levels. In the laboratory, survival was closely related to fine sediment. Survival to hatching was reduced to 28\% for eggs incubating in medium fine sediment treatment (20\%), and no eggs survived to hatching in high fine sediment (40\%). An exposure index was developed to investigate the effect on survival of increased exposure time of eggs to sediment. This index, suggests that exposure time to sediment was negatively related to survival and confirmed the importance of incorporating exposure time in future studies. In the field, no significant difference was detected in egg survival between the control sites (upstream of culverts) and test sites (downstream of culverts), and a similar result was found for total fine sediment. The assessment did highlight that variation in culvert location and design can influence sediment input into rivers, and the exposure index again confirmed that exposure time to sediment is important in the field.},

  abstract = {Bedload is notoriously challenging to measure and model; its dynamics, therefore, remains largely unknown in most fluvial systems worldwide. We present results from a global scale bedload flux model as part of the WBMsed modeling framework that well predict the distribution of water discharge, suspended sediment and bedload. The sensitivity of bedload predictions to river slope, particle size, discharge, river width, and suspended sediment were analyzed, showing the model to be most responsive to spatial dynamics in river discharge and slope. The relationship between bedload and total sediment flux is analyzed globally, and for representative longitudinal river profiles (Amazon, Mississippi, and Lena Rivers). The results show that while the proportion of bedload decreases from headwaters to the coasts, there is considerable variability between basins and along river corridors. The topographic and hydrological longitudinal profiles of rivers are shown to be the key drivers of bedload trends, with fluctuations in slope controlling its more local dynamics. Estimates of water and sediment fluxes to global oceans from 2,067 largest river outlets (draining 67\% of the global continental area) are provided. Estimated water discharge at 30,579 km3/y corresponds well to past estimates; however, sediment flux is higher. Total global particulate load of 17.8 Gt/y is delivered to global oceans, 14.8 Gt/y as washload, 1.1 Gt/y as bedload, and 2.6 Gt/y as suspended bed material. The largest 25 rivers are predicted to transport more than half of the total sediment flux to global oceans.},

The work required national scale sediment source apportionment to assess the current contributions of diffuse agricultural and urban sector losses, channel bank erosion and point source discharges to the total suspended sediment loads delivered to all rivers. Results suggested that the agricultural sector dominates present day (year 2000) sediment inputs to rivers (1929~kt=76\%) compared to eroding channel banks (394~kt=15\%), diffuse urban sources (147~kt=6\%) and point source discharges (76~kt=3\%). Projected change in farming by 2015, represented by the Business as Usual forecast of structural developments and predicted uptake of sediment mitigation methods, suggested an overall 9\% reduction in sediment loss from the agricultural sector across England and Wales. The projected reduction is unlikely to deliver sediment compliance in all catchments. Key limitations of the integrated modelling approach are discussed.},

Because the multiple interactions could lead to unstable feedbacks, we go through a careful process of model spin up to ensure that all components are stable and the interactions balanced.

The reason for the evaluation phase is that the model is to be used for the core climate simulations carried out by the Met Office Hadley Centre for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), so it is essential that addition of the extra complexity does not detract substantially from its climate performance. Localised changes in some specific meteorological variables can be identified, but the impacts on the overall simulation of present day climate are slight. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} This model is proving valuable both for climate predictions, and for investigating the strengths of biogeochemical feedbacks.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

To test this hypothesis, two ADCPs working at three frequencies (3 MHz and 1 MHz, M9; 2 MHz, StreamPro) were deployed simultaneously to measure seven different bedload transport conditions in a laboratory flume. The bedload transport was monitored by two high-speed cameras and a bedload trap. For some experiments 3 MHz and 1 MHz delivered spatially averaged apparent velocity, for others the velocity corresponded to the average velocity of particles. The 2 MHz severely underestimated the average particle velocity. The M9 backscattering strength decreased as the bedload concentration increased, independently of the size and velocity of transported particles. The 2 MHz resulted in almost constant backscattering strength. These findings demonstrate that further examination of the acoustic configurations and parameters could lead to a methodology for bedload quantification based solely on the acoustic outputs.},

An aerial photogrammetric survey digitally described the terrain. Measurements during and after the floods, and a global positioning system survey of positions from photographic records and other information recalled years later by flood plain residents, provided flood level, depth, and extent data to test the model. Uncalibrated, with inputs from the river and levee overtopping or breaches, the model underestimated levels, depths, and the area covered by floodwaters. The estimates were sufficiently close to be useful for flood plains without previous flood measurements. Calibrated to reproduce the measured flood extents, the model gave levels and depths closer to reality that were good at the edges of the flood plain subareas, but underestimated depths in the center of the flow. The underestimates occurred because the model did not include details of houses, hedges, and fences, nor any wave action of the water flow. A comparison is made to one-dimensional modeling using the MIKE11 model. Two-dimensional flood plain flow modeling promises benefits over one-dimensional modeling, in particular because the former does not require operator choice of a network of ``channels'' to represent the flood plain. The two-dimensional modeling reported here shows that improving the accuracy of the digital terrain model would provide the most improvement to accuracy of the results. Model functionality could also usefully be improved.},

In this paper we describe an open-source solution to data management, archiving, and sharing that can be implemented and customized by someone with limited computer programming experience using free software and standardized web services. This software, HydroServer Lite, is a light-weight database and data management web-based application that integrates with and makes data available on a large data sharing network developed by the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI). The CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System facilitates data sharing through a network of local HydroServers that are registered with the central registry. Each HydroServer may contain a variety of ecological and climate data, stored in a standardized relational database model. Someone searching for data that are registered in the central registry can query the network by source, location, variable type, and dates. These data can be downloaded from the local HydroServer to a computer in an office or lab where they can be manipulated and analyzed without compromising the data in the archives. We offer this HydroServer Lite case study as a possible solution for independent research laboratories looking for a data management system that requires little technical expertise or initial cost to set up.},

Fluorescence measurements have gained popularity, as they can be made rapidly, non-intrusively and, because of the portable nature of many fluorimeters, in situ. However, there is a paucity of literature for those new to the technique and most scientific papers assume a degree of prior knowledge. This paper provides a basic introduction for fluorescence techniques, particularly for benthic diatomists, explaining complex photophysiological theory in a simplified manner to allow inexperienced workers to interpret their data and understand fluorescence-based scientific papers. The commercially available fluorimeters and their specific applications are discussed. Fluorescence parameters can be used to provide information on the biomass, "health" and primary productivity of microphytobenthic biofilms. However, benthic biofilms offer their own challenges for photophysiologists, with the sedimentary environment complicating measurements as well as the ability of microphytobenthic taxa, such as diatoms, to migrate as fluorescence measurements are being made. Therefore, the paper ends by discussing some of the inherent problems and limitations of using fluorescence, presenting a constructively critical overview of these techniques so that the reader can make informed decisions about the validity of their data and be aware of many potential pitfalls.},

  abstract = {Rivers typically present heterogeneous bed material, but the effects of sediment nonuniformity on river bar characteristics are still unclear. This work investigates the impact of sediment size heterogeneity on alternate bars with a morphodynamic numerical model. The model is first used to reproduce a laboratory experiment showing alternate bar formation with nonuniform bed material. Subsequently, the influence of sediment size heterogeneity on alternate bars is investigated distinguishing hybrid from free bars, definition based on the presence/absence of morphodynamic forcing, considering the results of nine scenarios. In four of them, a transverse obstacle is used to generate forcing. The computations are carried out with the Telemac-Mascaret system solving the two-dimensional shallow-water equations with a finite element approach, accounting for horizontal and vertical sediment sorting processes. The results show that sediment heterogeneity affects free migrating and hybrid bars in a different way. The difference lies in the presence/absence of a migration front, so that distinct relations between bed topography, bed shear stress, and sediment sorting are obtained. Sediment sorting and associated planform redistribution of bed roughness only slightly modify free migrating bar morphodynamics, whereas hybrid bars are greatly impacted, with decreased amplitude and increased wavelength. Increased sediment size heterogeneity increases the degree of sediment sorting, while the sorting pattern remains the same for both free and hybrid bars. Moreover, it produces averagely higher, longer, and faster free bars, while in the case of hybrid bars their wavelength is increased but no general trend can be determined for their amplitude.},

The present study aimed at investigating the combined influence of flow and longitudinal width variations on the co-evolution between bar pattern and sediment sorting in a sandy-gravel river reach. To this goal, a fully non-linear 2D numerical model was developed to reproduce the morphodynamic behavior of bars in a reach of the Loire River consisting in a typical channel expansion/contraction. Numerical results showed that varying water discharge promoted a competition between low and high bar modes: i.e., from alternate to multiple bar patterns. Low bar modes were associated with coarse sediment over bar tops and fine sediment in pools, and this sorting pattern was inverted for higher bar modes. Surface sediment was coarser and the degree of sediment sorting was greater after periods of low than high flow. Due to high sediment mobility, sediment sorting did not significantly modify bar morphodynamics.},

This novel combination addresses two issues of existing SPH and FLIP solvers, namely mass preservation in FLIP and efficiency and memory consumption in SPH. First, the SPH component enables the simulation of incompressible fluids with perfect mass preservation. Second, the FLIP component efficiently enriches the SPH component with detail that is comparable to a standard SPH simulation with the same number of particles, while improving the performance by a factor of 7 and significantly reducing the memory consumption. We demonstrate that the proposed IISPH-FLIP solver can simulate incompressible fluids with a quantifiable, imperceptible density deviation below 0.1\%. We show large-scale scenarios with up to 160 million particles that have been processed on a single desktop PC using only 15GB of memory. One- and two-way coupled solids are illustrated.},

Existing models of helical motion in open-channel bends depict flow that is characterized by surface flow towards the outer bank, and basal flow towards the inner bank. This paper investigates and compares, through an analytical model and physical experiment, flows within fluvial meanders, and submarine channel bends that contain density-driven gravity currents. The results indicate that the sense of helical motion can be reversed in submarine bends that contain density currents when compared with fluvial bends, and that the orientation of the helical flow is dependent on the vertical distribution of downstream velocity. Specifically, the sense of helical motion is reversed in bends when the maximum downstream velocity is near the bed, resulting in near-bed flow towards the outer bank. These findings suggest that the dynamics of sediment transport and deposition in curved channels with such velocity profiles will be fundamentally different to those currently assumed from sinuous openchannels.},

Land use in the South Bohemia of the Czech Republic is dominated by forest and pasture, whereas in the Midwest U.S., land use is dominated by row crop agriculture. Cs-137 and 210Pb dating of soil cores revealed comparable rates of soil accretion among wetland types, ranging from 0.5mm/yr in a Czech floodplain wetland to 2.3mm/yr in a U.S. depressional wetland. Carbon sequestration and N \& P burial did not differ among floodplain (47+14gC/m2/yr, 3.7+1gN/m2/yr, 0.47+0.16g P/m2/yr) and depressional wetlands (50+19g/m2/yr, 3.6+1.3gN/m2/yr, 0.51+0.14g P/m2/yr). However, sediment deposition in Czech floodplain and depressional wetlands was only 10{\textendash}50\% (150{\textendash}340g/m2/yr) of rates measured in U.S. wetlands (650{\textendash}1460g/m2/yr).

More reliable and reproducible extraction protocols for microplastics would facilitate comparisons across studies. A number of different extraction techniques are currently used to separate microplastics from sediment and almost exclusively employ density-based separations, which take advantage of the inherent densities of plastic particles. Some of these techniques are cost-effective but fail to fully recover all plastic types. Other techniques may recover most plastic types, but are more costly and/or hazardous to human or environmental health. We present here a novel, cost-effective oil extraction protocol (OEP) that provides an alternative to density-based approaches by taking advantage of the oleophilic properties of microplastics. Using this technique, we counted microplastic particles in spiked sediment samples using light microscopy and observed 96.1\% {$\pm$} 7.4 recovery for total microplastics, with recovery rates of 92.7\% {$\pm$} 4.3 for fibers and 99\% {$\pm$} 1.4 for particles. Subsequent analysis with Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR) revealed that the oil interfered with the FTIR spectrum of microplastics, but that an additional, post-extraction clean-up step using ethyl alcohol (90\%) removed residual traces of oil and eliminated the FTIR spectral interference. The application of this new technique to shoreline sediment samples collected from sites in urban Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and a remote beach on Vancouver Island, as well as bulk seawater, demonstrated that the oil extraction protocol is effective for environmental samples. This novel OEP represents a cost-effective and reliable alternative to leading density-based techniques.},

Planning and operation of sustainable sediment management measures, as flushing, is essential to maintain reservoirs as renewable resources. This work analyses the real case of the Valgrosina reservoir, in the Northern Italy. Here, the managing Company A2A operated some flushing cycles in the recent past. The flushing parameters were evaluated through the REServoir CONservation (RESCON 2) tool. The consultation of site monitoring data aided in calibrating the model.

  abstract = {Snow is a critical component of the climate system, provides fresh water for millions of people globally, and affects forest and wildlife ecology. Snowy regions are typically data sparse, especially in mountain environments. Remotely-sensed snow cover data are available globally but are challenging to convert into accessible, actionable information. SnowCloudMetrics is a web portal for on-demand production and delivery of snow information including snow cover frequency (SCF) and snow disappearance date (SDD) using Google Earth Engine (GEE). SCF and SDD are computed using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Snow Cover Binary 500 m (MOD10A1) product. The SCF and SDD metrics are assessed using 18 years of Snow Telemetry records at more than 750 stations across the Western U.S. SnowCloudMetrics provides users with the capacity to quickly and efficiently generate local-to-global scale snow information. It requires no user-side data storage or computing capacity, and needs little in the way of remote sensing expertise. SnowCloudMetrics allows users to subset by year, watershed, elevation range, political boundary, or user-defined region. Users can explore the snow information via a GEE map interface and, if desired, download scripts for access to tabular and image data in non-proprietary formats for additional analyses. We present global and hemispheric scale examples of SCF and SDD. We also provide a watershed example in the transboundary, snow-dominated Amu Darya Basin. Our approach represents a new, user-driven paradigm for access to snow information. SnowCloudMetrics benefits snow scientists, water resource managers, climate scientists, and snow related industries providing SCF and SDD information tailored to their needs, especially in data sparse regions.},

This report presents results of a three-year study by the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the California Ecosystem Restoration Program of the California Bay-Delta Authority and the California Resources Agency. Streamflow and suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) samples were collected at four gaging stations; however, this report focuses on sediment transport at the Middle Yuba River (11410000) and the South Yuba River (11417500) gaging stations. Seasonal suspended-sediment rating curves were developed using a group-average method and non-linear least-squares regression. Bed-load transport relations were used to develop bed-load rating curves, and bed-load measurements were collected to assess the accuracy of these curves. Annual suspended-sediment loads estimated using seasonal SSC rating curves were compared with previously published annual loads estimated using the Graphical Constituent Loading Analysis System (GCLAS). The percent difference ranged from -85 percent to...},

In this study we compared the content and composition of extracellular substances from different types of sediments in the shallow littoral areas of clear and dark Canadian Shield lakes. We report high content of extracellular substances in these littoral sediments, in terms of both carbohydrates and proteins. Total carbohydrate contents increased with increasing sediment chlorophyll content in a relationship very similar to that reported for marine intertidal mudflats. Light availability and sediment type affected the content and composition of exopolymeric substances (EPS) in complex ways. More loosely bound (colloidal) EPS were measured in sandy sediments of dark lakes. Colloidal EPS content did not vary with changes in sediment particle size in clear lakes but may have been positively related to sediment particle size in dark lakes. Tightly bound (capsular) EPS increased with sediment water content with no effect of light availability. These relationships are consistent across the seven lakes. The role of these carbo hydrates and proteins in the productivity and nutrient dynamics of littoral areas in lakes remains to be tested.},

Calibration and validation (C/V) are fundamental processes used to demonstrate that an H/WQ model can produce suitable results in a particular application. However, the lack of comprehensive guidelines has led to the use of ad hoc, inconsistent, and incomplete C/V processes, which have made it difficult to interpret the myriad of published modeling studies, reduced the utility of many modeling applications, and slowed the advancement of H/WQ modeling. The objective of this article is to provide a generalized structure and process to assist modelers in developing a C/V strategy for H/WQ modeling applications. These best practice recommendations were developed based on an expansive review of the modeling literature, including a special collection of articles on H/WQ model calibration, validation, and use, as well as extensive discussion and debate among the authors. The model C/V recommendations include careful consideration, execution, and documentation of the following elements: (1) goals of model use, (2) data and parameters used in C/V, and (3) model C/V processes. Considerations in element 3 include the warm-up period, C/V strategy complexity, C/V process staging, spatiotemporal allocation of C/V comparison data, manual vs. automatic C/V, and additional diagnostics. Notable examples from the literature are provided for each strategy element. The comprehensive C/V strategy described herein will allow for better interpretation of future modeling studies, improved utility of modeling applications, and more systematic advancement of H/WQ models.},

  abstract = {Land-use change is related to climate change as both a causal factor and a major way in which the effects of climate change are expressed. As a causal factor, land use influences the flux of mass and energy, and as land-cover patterns change, these fluxes are altered. Projected climate alterations will produce changes in land-cover patterns at a variety of temporal and spatial scales, although human uses of the land are expected to override many effects. A review of the literature dealing with the relationship between land-use change and climate change clearly shows that (1) in recent centuries land-use change has had much greater effects on ecological variables than has climate change; (2) the vast majority of land-use changes have little to do with climate change or even climate; and (3) humans will change land use, and especially land management, to adjust to climate change and these adaptations will have some ecological effects. Therefore, an understanding of the nonclimatic causes of land-use change (e.g., socioeconomics and politics) are necessary to manage ecological functions effectively on regional and global scales.},

Equations in channel-fitted coordinates are then integrated over the depth to obtain a set of depth-averaged two-dimensional equations that are then solved using the MacCormack explicit finite-difference scheme. The results of the mathematical model are compared for verification to experimental data obtained on a laboratory test facility. The agreement between the computed and measured water levels is satisfactory. However, the computed wave speed is slower than the measured wave speed when the flow is near critical conditions.

  abstract = {The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is an efficient derivative-free optimization algorithm. It optimizes a black-box objective function over a well-defined parameter space in which feature functions are often defined manually. Therefore, the performance of those techniques strongly depends on the quality of the chosen features or the underlying parametric function space. Hence, enabling CMA-ES to optimize on a more complex and general function class has long been desired. In this paper, we consider modeling the input spaces in blackbox optimization non-parametrically in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). This modeling leads to a functional optimisation problem whose domain is a RKHS function space that enables optimisation in a very rich function class. We propose CMA-ES-RKHS, a generalized CMA-ES framework that is able to carry out blackbox functional optimisation in RKHS. A search distribution on non-parametric function spaces, represented as a Gaussian process, is adapted by updating both its mean function and covariance operator. Adaptive and sparse representation of the mean function and the covariance operator can be retained for efficient computation in the updates and evaluations of CMA-ES-RKHS by resorting to sparsification. We will also show how to apply our new black-box framework to search for an optimum policy in reinforcement learning in which policies are represented as functions in a RKHS. CMA-ES-RKHS is evaluated on two functional optimization problems and two bench-marking reinforcement learning domains.},

  abstract = {Accurate modeling and prediction of suspended sediment load (SSL) in rivers have an important role in environmental science and design of engineering structures and are vital for watershed management. Since different parameters such as rainfall, temperature, and discharge with the different lag times have significant effects on the SSL, quantifying and understanding nonlinear interactions of the sediment dynamics has always been a challenge. In this study, three soft computing models (multilayer perceptron (MLP), adaptive neuro-fuzzy system (ANFIS), and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)) were used to predict daily SSL. Four optimization algorithms (sine{\textendash}cosine algorithm (SCA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), firefly algorithm (FFA), and bat algorithm (BA)) were used to improve the capability of SSL prediction of the models. Data from gauging stations at the mouth of the Kasilian and Talar rivers in northern Iran were used in the analysis. The selection of input combinations for the models was based on principal component analysis (PCA). Uncertainty in sequential uncertainty fitting (SUFI-2) and performance indicators were used to assess the potential of models. Taylor diagrams were used to visualize the match between model output and observed values. Assessment of daily SSL predictions for Talar station revealed that ANFIS-SCA yielded the best results (RMSE (root mean square error): 934.2 ton/day, MAE (mean absolute error): 912.2 ton/day, NSE (Nash{\textendash}Sutcliffe efficiency): 0.93, PBIAS: 0.12). ANFIS-SCA also yielded the best results for Kasilian station (RMSE: 1412.10 ton/day, MAE: 1403.4 ton/day, NSE: 0.92, PBIAS: 0.14). The Taylor diagram confirmed that ANFIS-SCA achieved the best match between observed and predicted values for various hydraulic and hydrological parameters at both Talar and Kasilian stations. Further, the models were tested in Eagel Creek Basin, Indiana state, USA. The results indicated that the ANFIS-SCA model reduced RMSE by 15\% and 21\% compared to the MLP-SCA and RBFNN-SCA models in the training phase. Comparing models performance indicated that the ANFIS-SCA model could decrease MAE error compared to ANFIS-BA, ANFIS-PSO, ANFIS-FFA, and ANFIS models by 18\%, 32\%, 37\%, and 49\% in the training phase, respectively. The results indicated that the integration of optimization algorithms and soft computing models can improve the ability of models for predicting SSL. Additionally, the hybridization of soft computing models with optimization algorithms can decrease the uncertainty of models.},

The main objective of this paper is to develop an efficient Genetic Algorithm (GA) based auto-calibration method for HEC-HMS model (HMS-GA) for continuous snowmelt simulation. A general novel procedure is presented in the absence of the HMS source code to link a heuristic algorithm with the HEC program through Jython programming language. The models are developed and evaluated using daily data from basins in Ajichai, northwestern Iran. A comparison of results for a verification period indicates a substantial improvement by applying the HMS-GA over the other available methods. Moreover, it is shown that neither NM nor UG is able to improve the results obtained by either the manual or HMS-GA. Furthermore, the proposed method significantly improves the calibrations of the HMS model found by the three other methods.},

  abstract = {The effect of channel sinuosity on flow pattern in meandering streams is investigated. The centerlines of the idealized meandering streams under consideration follow sine-generated curves, and the banks are rigid; the flow is turbulent and subcritical. This study focuses on the vertically averaged flow over a flat ͑horizontal at any cross section͒ bed formed by a granular material. The ``flat bed'' is viewed as the initial surface of a moveable bed at the beginning of an experiment ͑at time t = 0͒. A series of laboratory flow measurements involving the systematic variation of the deflection angle ␪0 from 30 to 110{\textdegree}, is used. It is found that every different sinuosity ͑every different ␪0͒ has its own convective flow pattern, i.e., its own distribution in plan of ͑the L / 2 long͒ convergence{\textendash}divergence zones of flow. As ␪0 increases, a gradual change in flow pattern is observed. Two expressions defining the observed ␪0 variation of the convective flow pattern are introduced. It is shown, with the aid of the sediment transport continuity equation, that the geometry of the developed bed at the end of an experiment is strongly related to the convective behavior of the vertically averaged ͑initial͒ flow over the flat bed at t = 0. In particular, information on the ␪0 variation of the convective pattern of the initial flow can be used to estimate the location of erosion{\textendash}deposition zones and the location͑s͒ of the most intense erosion{\textendash}deposition corresponding to any ␪0.},

  abstract = {Streambed substrates have pervasive effects on stream biodiversity and biogeochemistry. The excessive input of fine sediments in streams and the subsequent alteration of the physical characteristics of streambed substrates are considered today as a major environmental issue. The estimation of streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) may be simpler than other estimations of reach-scale physical characteristics and could serve to quantify the alterations of streambeds across stream networks. In this study, we examined between-reach and within-reach variability and temporal changes of streambed K across 101 stream reaches in France, including nine reaches previously judged as clogged and nine as references (unclogged). We also examined the relationships between K and some environmental variables such as vertical hydraulic gradient, streambed grain size, flow velocity or distance to the bank. We demonstrated that 15 measurements of streambed K per reach could be used to compare streams among each other and over time. Clogged reaches displayed much lower K than reference reaches, and more generally, reach-averaged K and the number of non-null K values per reach allowed discriminating reaches among each other without observer bias. K was higher in upwelling compared with downwelling areas, probably because of fine sediment uplifting. With the low cost in terms of equipment ({$<$}{\texteuro}100 per unit) and time (2{\textendash}4 h per site), reach-scale streambed K estimates are promising for studying the alterations of streambed substrates across stream monitoring networks such as clogging, but also for understanding large-scale drivers of these alterations, or for upscaling recent developments in hyporheic ecology at the reach scale.

  abstract = {This study investigates the different stakeholder based discourses and challenges around the Franconian Lake District (FLD), a recently constructed large reservoir system in Germany. The construction and operation of reservoirs represent a massive alteration of their natural and social environments leading to discourses and potential conflicts between a wide scope of heterogeneous interest patterns. Studies have shown that large reservoirs can be an important contributor to water supply, irrigation, energy storage and therefore climate change mitigation on a global scale, which brings these conflicting interests to a broader societal concern. Yet, information about conflicts around existing (German) reservoirs is limited. To assess which issues and conflicts appear on the daily agenda and how they are perceived, communicated and addressed by the stakeholders, a total of 609 articles in the N{\"u}rnberger Nachrichten and 22 semi-structured expert interviews were analysed, using qualitative content analysis. The results show that discourses at FLD are predominantly determined by economic factors. Management issues are dominated by discussions about cyanobacteria, which can pose a health risk, thereby impeding recreational use of the lakes and consequently causing economic losses and an image problem for the region. The issue is also strongly interlinked with other aspects of concern and therefore one of the main challenges at the FLD. Due to the construction of the lakes and the evolving strong tourism sector, the formerly agricultural region was subject to a major structural change linking together a very heterogeneous set of interests. The results of this study can help in establishing a management framework to suit all stakeholders and possibly be transferrable to similar projects.},

Historical applications emphasized spatial variation in the environment (e.g., watershed land use and in situ primary productivity), but improved access to imagery archives facilitates better change detection over time. New sensor platforms and technology now yield imagery with higher spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions than ever before, which has accelerated development of remote sensing products that more accurately characterize aquatic environments. Free access to imagery archives, cloud computing, and availability of derived products linked to national hydrography databases are all removing historical barriers to its use by fisheries professionals. These advances in remote sensing have allowed new questions to be answered at finer spatial resolutions across broader landscapes and longer time frames, providing a new big-picture perspective to freshwater fisheries conservation and management.},

  abstract = {River morphology and behaviour are components of overall landscape behaviour, which responds to tectonic, volcanic, climatic and anthropogenic inputs. River morphology and behaviour adjust in response to these inputs to allow the available flow to transport the sediment supplied to base level at the rate at which it is supplied. To be sustainable, management of rivers to reduce flood hazards must therefore include measures to maintain the natural sediment transport capacity of the river. This is difficult in principle; there is evidence that the natural state of a river corresponds to a local maximum of bedload sediment transport capacity. Hence any moderate alteration will cause a decrease in sediment transport capacity, leading to aggradation, steepening of gradient and bank erosion. To achieve an artificial increase in sediment transport capacity therefore requires a substantial alteration of river form (usually narrowing), which in turn requires substantial structural works to maintain flood discharge and control local erosion. Experience in both Japan and Switzerland suggests that modification of rivers for flood control can be sustainable in both high and low sediment input environments if the economic base is sufficient to justify large expenditure on substantial river engineering works. However, New Zealand experience indicates that modification of active bedload-dominated rivers is much less sustainable in low-to moderately-developed land areas, where the required substantial modifications are not economically justifiable.}

  abstract = {The frictional influence of the seabed on the tidal flow in shelf seas and estuaries is usually modelled via a prescribed, spatially/temporally invariant drag coefficient. In practice, the seabed exhibits considerable variability, particularly spatially, that should in principle be included in simulations. Local variations in the seabed roughness (ks) alter the flow strength and, hence, local sediment transport rates. The effect of using a spatially/temporally varying ks is assessed here with reference to a tidal channel (Menai Strait, N. Wales) in which the variability of the bedforms has been monitored using multi-beam surveying. The channel not only exhibits strong tidal flow, but also a residual induced flow that is used here as diagnostic to assess various bed roughness formulations tested in a Telemac model. Tidal simulations have been carried out with both constant and temporally/spatially variable ks, and the predicted residual flow is shown to be sensitive to these representations. For a mean springneap (SN) cycle with variable ks, the average residual flow is calculated to be 525 m3 s-1, consistent with observations. This residual flow can be recovered using imposed, constant values of ks in the range 0.15 m to 0.3 m. The results suggest that the overall, effective roughness of the seabed is less than half of the maximum local roughness due to the dunes in mid-channel, but more than the spatially-averaged ks value in the channel as a whole by about 50\%. Simulations carried out with an M2-alone tide using variable ks produce a somewhat smaller (by 7\%) residual flow of 491 m3 s-1. The use of an `equivalent M2' tide of amplitude enhanced by 7.3\% reconciles these estimates. The main contribution to ks is made by dunes which are modelled using Van Rijn's (2007) formulation subject to an additional `history effect'. The modelled ks is found to equal approximately the observed height of the dunes along mid-channel transects rather than half the height as expected. This is attributed to the non-equilibrium nature of the bedforms in the reversing tidal flow, which exhibited shorter wavelength and more symmetrical profiles than dunes in steady flow.},

The main types of statistical models thus far proposed, based on latent variables, on copulas and on spatial max-stable processes, are described and then are compared by application to a data set on rainfall in Switzerland. Whereas latent variable modeling allows a better fit to marginal distributions, it fits the joint distributions of extremes poorly, so appropriately-chosen copula or max-stable models seem essential for successful spatial modeling of extremes.},

  abstract = {Bed load sediment transport, in which wind or water flowing over a bed of sediment causes grains to roll or hop along the bed, is a critically important mechanism in contexts ranging from river restoration1 to planetary exploration2. Despite its widespread occurrence, predictions of bed load sediment flux are notoriously imprecise3,4. Many studies have focused on grain size variability5 as a source of uncertainty, but few have investigated the role of grain shape, even though shape has long been suspected to influence transport rates6. Here we show that grain shape can modify bed load transport rates by an amount comparable to the scatter in many sediment transport datasets4,7,8. We develop a theory that accounts for grain shape effects on fluid drag and granular friction and predicts that the onset and efficiency of transport depend on the coefficients of drag and bulk friction of the transported grains. Laboratory experiments confirm these predictions and reveal that the effect of grain shape on sediment transport can be difficult to intuit from the appearance of grains. We propose a shape-corrected sediment transport law that collapses our experimental measurements. Our results enable greater accuracy in predictions of sediment transport and help reconcile theories developed for spherical particles with the behaviour of natural sediment grains.},

PGPR promote plant growth through several modes of action, be it directly or indirectly. The benefits provided by these bacteria can include increased nutrient availability, phytohormone production, shoot and root development, protection against several phytopathogens, and reduced diseases. Additionally, PGPR can help plants to withstand abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought and produce enzymes that detoxify plants from heavy metals. PGPR have become an important strategy in sustainable agriculture due to the possibility of reducing synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, promoting plant growth and health, and enhancing soil quality. There are many studies related to PGPR in the literature. However, this review highlights the studies that used PGPR for sustainable production in a practical way, making it possible to reduce the use of fertilizers such as phosphorus and nitrogen and fungicides, and to improve nutrient uptake. This review addresses topics such as unconventional fertilizers, seed microbiome for rhizospheric colonization, rhizospheric microorganisms, nitrogen fixation for reducing chemical fertilizers, phosphorus solubilizing and mineralizing, and siderophore and phytohormone production for reducing the use of fungicides and pesticides for sustainable agriculture.},

  abstract = {Soil conservation planning often requires estimates of soil erosion at a catchment or regional scale. Predictive models such as Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its subsequent Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) are useful tools to generate the quantitative estimates necessary for designing sound conservation measures. However, large-scale soil erosion model-factor parameterization and quantification is difficult due to the costs, labor and time involved. Among the soil erosion parameters, the vegetative cover or C factor has been one of the most difficult to estimate over broad geographic areas. The C factor represents the effects of vegetation canopy and ground covers in reducing soil loss. Traditional methods for the extraction of vegetation information from remote sensing data such as classification techniques and vegetation indices were found to be inaccurate. Thus, this study presents a new approach based on Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) of Landsat ETM data to map the C factor for use in the modeling of soil erosion. A desirable feature of SMA is that it estimates the fractional abundance of ground cover and bare soils simultaneously, which is appropriate for soil erosion analysis. Hence, we estimated the C factor by utilizing the results of SMA on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We specifically used a linear SMA (LSMA) model and performed a minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation and pixel purity index (PPI) on Landsat ETM image to derive the proportion of ground cover (vegetation and non-photosynthetic materials) and bare soil within a pixel. The end-members were selected based on the purest pixels found using PPI with reference to very high-resolution QuickBird image and actual field data. Results showed that the C factor value estimated using LSMA correlated strongly with the values measured in the field. The correlation coefficient (r) obtained was 0.94. A comparative analysis between NDVI- and LSMA-derived C factors also proved that the latter produced a more detailed spatial variability, as well as generated more accurate erosion estimates when used as input to RUSLE model. The QuickBird image coupled with field data was used in the validation of results.},

  abstract = {In this study, the spatial distribution of two operationally defined extracellular carbohydrate fractions (water- and EDTAextractable carbohydrates) were examined in three intertidal mudflats in Western Europe (Dollard, the Netherlands; Marennes, France; Humber, UK). The three mudflats were sampled along cross-shore transects and sediment cores were sliced to a depth of 5 cm. In these mudflats diatoms were the dominant component of the microphytobenthos. Carbohydrate content showed little variation with depth but varied along transects within each mudflat. Carbohydrate contents were also significantly different between mudflats and the carbohydrate contents of the stations within a mudflat grouped together resulting in separate clusters. This was also observed when the Marennes mudflat was investigated on a temporal scale. These results suggest that processes that act on the scale of whole mudflats determine the variations in extracellular carbohydrate contents. In the surface 0.5 cm of the sediment, waterextractable carbohydrates showed a correlation with both chlorophyll a content and median grain size while EDTA-extractable carbohydrates were only correlated with median grain size. Incubation experiments also showed the importance of microphytobenthos as a source of extracellular carbohydrate especially when subjected to the light. Analyses of the monosaccharide distribution of the carbohydrate fractions revealed that the carbohydrate composition was largely similar between the areas investigated. Structurally, the carbohydrates found in these sediments seem to represent a biorefractory part of the freshly produced carbohydrates that remained after rapid degradation of the more labile component.},

  abstract = {Microbial exopolymers are high molecular-weight mucous secretions of bacteria and microalgae. They range from tight capsules which closely surround cells to the loose-slime matrix associated with aggregates, sediment, detritus, and other surfaces. By virtue of their physical properties, exopolymers are highly adsorptive, and readily sequester dissolved organic matter and metals. Exopolymers are largely polysaccharide in composition, and can exist in 'dissolved' and 'particulate' form. These secretions serve many functions which enhance the survival and competitive success of microbial cells under natural conditions. While they have been well studied in other disciplines, the investigation of exopolymers in marine systems has been largely overlooked. Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that they influence a wide range of marine processes such as aggregate formation in the water column, benthic larval settlement, microscale biogeochemical processes, sediment stability, and metal sequestering by hydrothermal vent bacteria. In addition, when microbial consumers feed they coincidentally ingest exopolymers (and their adsorbed compounds). These secretions may, therefore, represent an effective vehicle to transfer nutrients and metals through lower marine food webs. This suggests a dynamic role for exopolymers in marine systems. As ocean paradigms are further revised, the potential roles of these secretions must certainly be addressed. The present review examines the properties, processes, and methodologies pertinent to the study of microbial exopolymers in ocean systems. Literature has been purposefully cited from various other disciplines where exopolymer-related processes have been well studied. A focus is made on attempting to understand the interactive roles of these secretions in food webs and other marine processes.}

The different physical and chemical properties of exopolymers could have secondary effects on trophic interactions between microbial cells and consumer animals. Laboratory studies showed that capsule EPS is significantly less digestible to consumers than slime EPS, even when extracted from the same bacterial strain. Bacterial cells with EPS capsules are less efficiently digested than noncapsuled cells, suggesting that capsules protect against digestion. Follow-up experiments determined that polysaccharide-rich fractions of slime EPS are absorbed with very high efficiencies while protein portions, which are more abundant in capsular polymers, are absorbed relatively poorly. Another series of experiments showed that dissolved organic matter (DOM), when adsorbed directly to the mineralogical portions of sediment particles, is available to deposit feeders. However, the further presence of an exopolymer coating on sediments more than doubled the bioavailability of adsorbed DOM to the consumer. Observations using cold-stage scanning electron microscopy indicated that exopolymer microenvironments are a common feature of natural marine sediments. Microbial exopolymers range from easily digestible carbon sources to relatively refractory ones that effectively protect some microbial cells from consumer digestion. Exopolymer microenvironments may also make recently absorbed DOM highly accessible to particle-ingesting animals.}

The suggestion that variation in predictive models of sediment stability might be due to site-specific characteristics is investigated using data from four estuarine mudflats (Eden Estuary, Scotland, the Biezelingsche Ham, Zandkreek, and Molenplaat mudflats in The Netherlands). These estuaries differ in their environmental conditions, macrofaunal species composition and local features (e.g. Enteromorpha mats, migratory biofilms). Stable and unstable sediments were compared, and mean chlorophyll-a concentrations and granulometry of the sediments were significantly different between the two groups. Step-wise multiple linear regressions were applied to the sediment stability data of all sites to establish the influences on erosion threshold of microphytobenthic biomass, water content, granulometry, organic carbon content and the abundance of dominant macrofaunal species. The stability of each site was influenced by different factors. Sediment stability of the Eden Estuary was affected by the Enteromorpha bloom; Biezelingsche Ham was influenced by the highly migratory nature of the diatom biofilms and the abundance of Corophium volutator; the polychaete worm Arenicola marina had a net negative effect on sediment stability of the Zandkreek; and the Molenplaat was influenced by microphytobenthic biomass. This research highlights the need for site-specific calibration of models and suggests that a universal proxy parameter for sediment stability is unlikely to be obtained.}

Natural assemblages of microphytobenthos provide a model system of considerable species richness that can be examined and manipulated easily under laboratory conditions. However, the relative temporal stability of these assemblages maintained under laboratory conditions in terms of species composition and community metabolism is not known. This information is required before the results from model systems employing assemblages of microphytobenthos can be properly interpreted. Natural assemblages of microphytobenthos were sampled, prepared and incubated in the laboratory under light levels representative of those found in the literature. Analysis of microphytobenthic assemblage composition (gross community change); biomass (chlorophyll a), composition of pigments and photophysiological status were assessed after a 14 d period. No changes in species richness were found, whilst diversity declined from the initial field values, but were similar when compared between assemblages maintained at different light levels. Field assemblages contained greater numbers of larger diatoms compared to the cultured assemblages. Photophysiological responses were similar between the 2 light treatments, although signs of photophysiological stress were observed. It was therefore shown that estuarine microphytobenthic assemblages appear to possess a certain degree of inertia when brought from the field into the reduced light regime of a laboratory. Microphytobenthic assemblages therefore provide a useful experimental model with relevance to natural conditions.}

If the local scour depth is estimated less than real one it can lead the hydraulic structure to fail. On the other hand, if this depth is estimated more than real local scour depth, that construction has no economical justification. Lateral intake is one the hydraulic structures which are used for water conveyance for the purpose of domestic, agricultural and industrial use. Since streamlines near the lateral intake are curved and diverted to lateral intake, some vortices are formed and local scour is observed near the lateral intake. Due to the secondary flow in a river bend, the scour develops near the outer bank and sediment moves toward the inner bank from the outer bank of the bend. Therefore the outer bank of the bend is best location for lateral intake. In this study, experiments were conducted on 180 degree curved channel. In order to consider the effect of lateral intake position on the maximum local scour depth, the lateral intake was situated on 90, 115 and 150 degree. The experiments showed that two scour holes, one in the upstream and the other in the downstream edge of lateral intake, are formed near the lateral intake. Moreover it was found that the maximum depth of scour hole occurs on 90{\r{}} location. Also the length of scour hole in 150{\r{}} is the longest.},

  abstract = {The numerical convergence of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) can be severely restricted by random force errors induced by particle disorder, especially in shear flows, which are ubiquitous in astrophysics. The increase in the number NH of neighbours when switching to more extended smoothing kernels at fixed resolution (using an appropriate definition for the SPH resolution scale) is insufficient to combat these errors. Consequently, trading resolution for better convergence is necessary, but for traditional smoothing kernels this option is limited by the pairing (or clumping) instability. Therefore, we investigate the suitability of the Wendland functions as smoothing kernels and compare them with the traditional B-splines. Linear stability analysis in three dimensions and test simulations demonstrate that the Wendland kernels avoid the pairing instability for allNH, despite having vanishing derivative at the origin (disproving traditional ideas about the origin of this instability; instead, we uncover a relation with the kernel Fourier transform and give an explanation in terms of the SPH density estimator). The Wendland kernels are computationally more convenient than the higher order B-splines, allowing large NH and hence better numerical convergence (note that computational costs rise sublinear with NH). Our analysis also shows that at low NH the quartic spline kernel with NH {$\approx$} 60 obtains much better convergence than the standard cubic spline.},

It is used as a validation case of its capability to reproduce flow and bed changes in this steep and laterally unconfined case with coarse sediment. The numerical model used a fractional transport approach enabling to compute grain size sorting and segregation processes. The fractional transport rates were computed with Meyer-Peter Muller equation. Water depth was computed with the ``variable power equation'' developed by Ferguson to account for both low, intermediate and high submergence (depth/grain size). Comparison of the numerical and physical models was done qualitatively (based on animations of the numerical results compared to videos of the physical model) and quantitatively computing an indicator of ratio of active channels (i.e., transporting sediment) measured using the large scale image velocimetry technique applied to time-lapse videos. The results show that fractional transport in itself does not bring significant improvement. However, dramatic improvements of the modelled channelization pattern and dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively, emerged when coupling the fractional transport with the friction law. In essence, when computing local grain size, it should be taken into account in the hydraulics too. This approach is a step forward to achieve better predictions of flow and channel dynamics on unconfined active morphologies and depositional systems.},

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called ``ImageNet'', a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500{\textendash}1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

  abstract = {This review provides an overview of concepts and approaches for the quantification of passive, non-reactive solute mixing in steady uniform porous media flows across scales. Mixing in porous media is the result of the interaction of spatial velocity fluctuations and diffusion or local-scale dispersion, which may lead to the homogenization of an initially segregated system. Velocity fluctuations are induced by spatial medium heterogeneities at the pore, Darcy or regional scales. Thus, mixing in porous media is a multiscale process, which depends on the medium structure and flow conditions. In the first part of the review, we discuss the interrelated processes of stirring, dispersion and mixing, and review approaches to quantify them that apply across scales. This implies concepts of hydrodynamic dispersion, approaches to quantify mixing state and mixing dynamics in terms of concentration statistics, and approaches to quantify the mechanisms of mixing. We review the characterization of stirring in terms of fluid deformation and folding and its relation with hydrodynamic dispersion. The integration of these dynamics to quantify the mechanisms of mixing is discussed in terms of lamellar mixing models. In the second part of this review, we discuss these concepts and approaches for the characterization of mixing in Poiseuille flow, and in porous media flows at the pore, Darcy and regional scales. Due to the fundamental nature of the mechanisms and processes of mixing, the concepts and approaches discussed in this review underpin the quantitative analysis of mixing phenomena in porous media flow systems in general.},

Frequently, however, there is not enough data available to compute the R value, and other parameters, such as the modified Fournier index (Fmod), are used instead. But RUSLE is less effective if only the alternative procedures exist. One of the major discrepancies between R and the alternative parameters is time resolution: individual storms are used to calculate R while monthly averages over the year are used to calculate Fmod. In this study, a multiple linear regression (r2=0.89) involving monthly EI30, monthly rainfall for days with {$\geq$}10.0mm and monthly number of days with rainfall {$\geq$}10.0mm, for the Algarve region, is presented. Twenty-seven years of monthly rainfall erosivity values were computed for the 32 standard daily-read raingauge stations of the Algarve region.},

  abstract = {River model calibration is essential for reliable model prediction. The manual calibration method is laborious and time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. River engineering software is now equipped with more complex tools that require a high number of parameters as input, rendering the task of model calibration even more difficult. This paper presents the calibration tool O.P.P.S. (Optimisation Program for PEST and SRH-2D) and then uses it in multiple calibration scenarios. O.P.P.S. combines PEST, a calibration software and SRH-2D, a bi-dimensional hydraulic and sediment model for river systems, into an easy-to-use set of forms. O.P.P.S is designed to minimise the user's interaction with the involved program to carry out rapid and functional calibration processes. PEST uses the Gauss{\textendash}Marquardt{\textendash}Levenberg algorithm to adjust the model's parameters by minimising an objective function containing the differences between field observation and modelgenerated values. The tool is used to conduct multiple calibration series of the modelled Ha! Ha! river in Qu{\'e}bec, with varying information content in the observation fields. A sensitivity study is also conducted to assess the behaviour of the calibration process in the presence of erroneous or imprecise measurements.},

When compared to a manual method, both methods yield broadly similar results in terms of relative erosion risk mapping. However, there appear to be important differences in absolute values. Although both methods yield similar slope values, the use of the manual method leads to an underestimation of the erosion risk because the effect of flow convergence is not accounted for. The computer procedure has the obvious advantage that it can easily be linked to GIS software. If data on land use and soils are available, specific K, C and P-values can be assigned to each land unit so that predicted soil losses can then be calculated using a simple overlay procedure. The algorithm leaves the user the choice to consider land units as being hydrologically isolated or continuous. A comparison with soil data showed a reasonably good agreement between the predicted erosion risk and the intensity of soil truncation observed in the test area.},

  abstract = {Estuarine soft sediments support a diverse group of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms though the role of the sediment per se for the functioning of these organisms remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to test the effect of sediment grain size on the grazing activities of harpacticoid copepods. In controlled experiments, two common intertidal harpacticoid species (Paramphiascella fulvofasciata and Nitokra spinipes) were each offered a mix of two benthic diatom species (Navicula phyllepta and Seminavis robusta) in different sedimentary conditions. Several microcosms were created using a variety of sediment types, including fine silt ({$<$} 63 mu m), coarser grained sands (125-250, 250-450, 100-300 mu m), artificial 'sediments' of glass beads (250-500, 2000 mu m) and even the absence of sediment was tested. The diatoms were enriched in the stable carbon C-13 to facilitate tracing in the harpacticoids. Both copepod species were able to graze oil the diatoms with highest uptake when sediment was absent. In contrast, both harpacticoid species showed no uptake in silty conditions. In general, grazing was favoured when mean sediment grain size increased. The strong negative effect of fine grains oil the grazer's efficiency can be explained by the resulting differences in the structure (and accessibility) of the diatom biofilm oil the one hand and the mobility of the grazer oil the other hand. In view of the subtle equilibrium between primary producers and grazers, these results might have important implications for the effect of siltation of tidal flats due to, e.g., human activities.

  abstract = {Assessments of the implications of soil erosion require quantification of soil erosion rates (SE) and sediment yield (SSY) at regional scales under present and future climate and land use scenarios. A range of models is available to predict SE and SSY, but a critical evaluation of these models is lacking. Here, we evaluate 14 models based on 32 published studies and over 700 selected catchments. Evaluation criteria include: (1) prediction accuracy, (2) knowledge gain on dominant soil erosion processes, (3) data and calibration requirements, and (4) applicability in global change scenario studies. Results indicate that modelling of SE and SSY strongly depends on the spatial and temporal scales considered. In large catchments ({$>$}10,000km2), most accurate predictions of suspended sediment yield are obtained by nonlinear regression models like BQART, WBMsed, or Pelletier's model. For medium-sized catchments, best results are obtained by factorial scoring models like PSIAC, FSM and SSY Index, which also support identification of dominant erosion processes. Most other models (e.g., WATEM{\textendash}SEDEM, AGNPS, LISEM, PESERA, and SWAT) represent only a selection of erosion and sediment transport processes. Consequently, these models only provide reliable results where the considered processes are indeed dominant. Identification of sediment sources and sinks requires spatially distributed models, which, on average, have lower model accuracy and require more input data and calibration efforts than spatially lumped models. Of these models, most accurate predictions with least data requirements were provided by SPADS and WATEM{\textendash}SEDEM. Priorities for model development include: (1) simulation of point sources of sediment, (2) balancing model complexity and the quality of input data, (3) simulation of the impact of soil and water conservation measures, and (4) incorporation of dynamic land use and climate scenarios. Prediction of the impact of global change on SE and SSY in medium sized catchments is one of the main challenges in future model development. No single model fulfils all modelling objectives; a further integration of field observations and different model concepts is needed to obtain better contemporary and future predictions of SE and SSY.},

Different geometries, characterized by different widths and lengths, are considered as well as different hydraulic conditions. First, the results of a series of experimental tests are briefly depicted. They reveal that, under clearly identified hydraulic and geometrical conditions, the flow pattern is found to become nonsymmetric, in spite of the symmetrical inflow conditions, outflow conditions and geometry of the basin. This non-symmetric motion results from the growth of small disturbances actually present in the experimental initial and boundary conditions. Second, numerical simulations are conducted based on a depth-averaged approach and a finite volume scheme. The simulation results reproduce the global pattern of the flow observed experimentally and succeed in predicting the stability or instability of a symmetric flow pattern for all tested configurations. Finally, an analytical study provides mathematical insights into the conditions under which the symmetric flow pattern becomes unstable and clarifies the governing physical processes.},

  abstract = {This experimental study is devoted to quantification of the near-bed turbulence characteristics at an entrainment threshold of noncohesive sediments. Near the bed, the departure in the distributions of the observed time-averaged streamwise velocity from the logarithmic law is more for immobile beds than for entrainment-threshold beds. In the Reynolds shear stress distributions, a damping that occurs near the bed for sediment entrainment is higher than that for immobile beds. Quadrant analysis reveals that in the near-bed flow zone, ejections and sweeps on immobile beds cancel each other, giving rise to the outward interactions, whereas sweeps are the dominant mechanism toward sediment entrainment. The bursting duration for entrainment-threshold beds is smaller than that for immobile beds. On the other hand, the bursting frequency for entrainment-threshold beds is larger than that for immobile beds. The third-order correlations indicate that during sediment entrainment, a streamwise acceleration associated with a downward flux and advection of streamwise Reynolds normal stress is prevalent. The streamwise and the downward vertical fluxes of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) increase with sediment entrainment. The TKE budget proves that for sediment entrainment, the pressure energy diffusion changes drastically to a negative magnitude, indicating a gain in turbulence production.}

Insertion of vertical submerged vanes in the channel bend at an optimum angle with the tangential component of flow can minimize the unsteadiness and generation of secondary flow resulting in the reduction of scour depth at the outer bank. A series of experiments were conducted in a 180{\textdegree} bend laboratory channel to study flow erosion and effective ness of the submerged vane in reducing scour depth. The average approach to flow velocity at 0.20 m flow depth above the lowest initial bed level was 25 cm/s. An Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) was used to measure the three-dimensional time-averaged velocity components at different azimuthal sections on stabilized nonscoured beds without vane. Scour bed profile without vanes shows that bank erosion in a 180{\textdegree} parabolic-shaped bed channel occurs mostly at the zone from bend angles 120{\textdegree} to 140{\textdegree}. Vanes were installed at angles of 10{\textdegree}, 15{\textdegree}, 20{\textdegree}, 30{\textdegree}, and 40{\textdegree} to the tangential flow component maintaining a spacingof 75 cm distance from one vane to another. Experimental results show that a 15{\textdegree} vane angle produces best result in reducing outer bank scour in a parabolic-shaped channel. The data presented in this paper can also be used for validating three-dimensional turbulence models for simulating flows in a curved channel.},

  abstract = {Substrate facies monitoring is critical for the understanding of fluvial geomorphologic and ecohydraulic patterns and processes. However, direct substrate measurement is time-consuming and subjected to data sparsity because of small sample, size, and limited data collections within an area of interest, which make it difficult to capture facies patterns. Most new experimental studies focus on mapping substrate based on median grain size of a specific grain size class using automatic or semiautomatic photosieving techniques. This study aimed to develop and apply a method to accurately predict size-mixture facies patterns on exposed riverbeds with minimal ground truth plots (100) using airborne lidar and machine learning. The selected testbed river was a 37.5-km stretch of the regulated lower Yuba River in California, USA, mapped at sub-meter resolution in 2017. First, we designed a grid-by-point grain size sampling method and binned grain sizes into representative mixtures, such as fine or large gravel, to assign subaerial facies labels. Second, we classified facies based on a multivariate cluster analysis. Third, we generated 15 lidar-derived topographic and spectral predictors. Six distinct size-mixture facies were identified from field data and a seventh, pure sand facies, from UAV data. A random forest predictive model with an 86\% 10-fold cross-validation accuracy was applied to produce a facies map at the 1.54 m pixel scale. The detrended elevation was identified as the most important variable for predicting facies spatial patterning, followed by baseflow, wetted area proximity, and green lidar intensity. We conclude that machine learning combined with intensity lidar data is highly effective for distinguishing mixed classes of substrates. Ultimately, the new substrate mixture-binning approach also provides novel insights into the arrangement of river sediment facies patterns.},

  abstract = {In this study, a hydromorphological model of the Rosenheim reservoir, one of the impoundments formed by a chain of run-of-river power plants along the Inn River (Germany), was developed by coupling TELEMAC-2D and SISYPHE. Available bathymetry surveys, conducted after the high magnitude flood events in 2005 and 2013, were used for calibration and validation respectively. The implementation of the subroutines modified by the Chair of Hydraulic and Water Resources Engineering of the Technical University of Munich together with the selection of a low angle of friction of the sediment for the secondary currents correction produced a good match between the measured and simulated cross-section profiles. The model's ability to predict the bed variation after the event was evaluated using the Brier Skill Score (BSS) and considering the initial bathymetry as the baseline prediction. Applying this technique, the three following parameters were considered: (i) phase error to assess the accuracy of the location of erosion and deposition processes, (ii) amplitude error to evaluate the bed evolution magnitude and (iii) mean map error to estimate the bias of the simulation against the measurements. The model was successfully calibrated and validated with BSS values being in the category of excellent and good together with a high number of cross-sections featuring low phase, amplitude and mean map errors. The calibrated model is presently applied to other flood events in the reservoir.},

ArcSWAT is public domain software which works in the licensed ArcGIS environment. The aim of this paper was to develop an open source user interface for the SWAT model. The interface, QSWAT, is written in the Python programming language and uses various functionalities of the open source geographic information system, QGIS. The current interface performs similar functions to ArcSWAT, but with additional enhanced features such as merging small subbasins and static and dynamic visualization of outputs. The interface is demonstrated through a case study in the Gumera watershed in the Lake Tana basin of Ethiopia, where it showed a successful performance. QSWAT will be a valuable tool for the SWAT scientific community, with improved availability and functionality compared with other options for creating SWAT models.},

The objective was to evaluate two known models (MMFI and GJRM), and compare the results with the novel model REMDB meant for complex terrains. MMFI and GJRM are both based on the precipitation amount, whilst REMDB takes site latitude, elevation and precipitation seasonality also into account. The test area was the Italian region, where 30 stations (altitudes from about sea level up to 1270 m, over the latitudinal range 36{\textendash}46{\textdegree}North) with sufficient data to calculate Rm according to USLE were available. The three models were evaluated against USLE rainfall erosivity over a validation data set of 14 stations, using a range of performance statistics. The REMDB estimates generally compared well with the USLE estimates according to different statistics. For REMDB, the relative root mean square error was, in average, 48.58\% against 71.49\% for MMFI and 66.55\% for GJRM. The average modelling efficiency of REMDB was 0.51 against {\`A}0.02 (MMFI) and 0.13 (GJRM). REMDB was also superior in preventing biased errors in time, as quantified by the average pattern index versus months: 17.65 MJ mm h{\`A}1 ha{\`A}1 month{\`A}1, against 58.54 MJ mm h{\`A}1 ha{\`A}1 month{\`A}1 (MMFI) and 57.76 MJ mm h{\`A}1 ha{\`A}1 month{\`A}1 (GJRM). Of the two simplified models, the MMFI was the worst performer while the GJRM model performed similarly to the REMDB at two mid-altitude sites of Central Italy.},

Two known models of rainfall erosivity (named after the first author of the original paper, Torri and Yang) were also assessed and compared with the MedREM. Yang and Torri models are both based on the annual precipitation models. MedREM also takes annual maximum daily precipitation data into account, and incorporates a longitude-dependent coefficient. The test area was a large region centered on the Mediterranean basin, in which 66 weather stations were available {\textendash} 43 Italian and 23 out-of-Italy sites (12 countries, about 30{\textendash}50{\textdegree} latitude North, and 10{\textendash}50{\textdegree} longitude East) {\textendash}with multi-year data of (R)USLE annual erosivity. The three models were calibrated against (R)USLE rainfall erosivity data from 55 stations and evaluated over a validation dataset from 11 Italian stations. On the validation dataset, the MedREM estimates generally compared well with the (R)USLE data according to Nush{\textendash}Sutcliffe coefficient (0.87 against 0.76 and 0.73 with Torri and Yang model, respectively). Implications for erosivity modelling were discussed in the context of climatic features concluding that accurate estimations of site-specific annual erosivity for the Mediterranean region require process-based model with spatially-explicit parameterization.},

  abstract = {Multivariate geostatistical modeling can be used to generate spatial patterns of hydro-climate data over ungauged regions, but these models may be unsuitable when the hydro-climatological data available over large and remote areas are sparse and show different scales of resolution. In these cases, reduced complexity modeling can be better used in order to increase understanding of hydrological extremes at spatial scales and over time periods not covered by rainfall records. In this study we present and evaluate the African Rainfall Erosivity Subregional Empirical Downscaling (ARESED) model which has been developed based on hydro-climatological and geotopographic data from 46 stations across Africa with very varied climates and elevations. We spatially downscale the 85th percentile of monthly precipitation, based on several decades of data, from 50km to 10km grid squares in order to predict values of rainfall erosivity across Africa. This yields inputs comparable to values based on the standard Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The 46 African stations were chosen for model development because they are also sites for which there are RUSLE-based erosivity values. Once parameterized to capture mean rainfall erosivity over several decades, the ARESED model was run as a validation tool, comparing the output with actual erosivity data. On a continental scale and over decadal time scales, the ARESED model captures most of the important processes within the hydro-climatological system. Its reduced complexity structure also makes it suitable for application to regional management and environmental planning.},

  abstract = {In European catchments, rainfall and overland flow trigger erosive processes that could result in soil detachment and transportation. However, estimation of both erosive rainfalls and sediment yields is very challenging, especially in historical times when only precipitations at seasonal or annual scales are available. This motivated us to develop a parsimonious hydroclimatological model (ASCLIM, Annual Sediment CLImatological Model) for predicting catchment scale sediment yield when temporal and spatial high-resolution precipitation data are not available. The model was developed by using the annual data of suspended-sediment yield from Glonn basin (1981{\textendash}1995, gauge of Hohenkammer, Germany) and seasonal rainfall data from a NOAA data set. The correlation coefficient between predicted and observed sediment yields was 0.94 and the efficiency index was 0.89. Once parameterized, the model was able to capture annual sediment yield variability better than the Langbein{\textendash}Schumm and the Fournier Index equations, also based on limited sets of inputs. The model holds potential for historical reconstruction of sediment yields in the Glonn catchment (assuming constant land cover) and for simulating sediment fluxes from catchments with similar characteristics. Our application highlights the control of rainfall seasonality on sediment export and demonstrates that our sediment yield proxy could be considered as a good tool for the expectation and planning of soil conservation. Moreover, considering that we used modeled data to reconstruct past sediment loss, we could expect that using projected future rainfall data our proxy could be able to assess future scenarios.},

  abstract = {In order to successfully calibrate an urban drainage model, multiple calibration criteria should be considered. This raises the issue of adopting a method for comparing different solutions (parameter sets) according to a set of objectives. Amongst the global optimization techniques that have blossomed in recent years, Multi Objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGA) have proved effective in numerous engineering applications, including sewer network modelling. Most of the techniques rely on the condition of Pareto efficiency to compare different solutions. However, as the number of criteria increases, the ratio of Pareto optimal to feasible solutions increases as well. The pitfalls are twofold: the efficiency of the genetic algorithm search worsens and decision makers are presented with an overwhelming number of equally optimal solutions. This paper proposes a new MOGA, the Preference Ordering Genetic Algorithm, which alleviates the drawbacks of conventional Pareto-based methods. The efficacy of the algorithm is demonstrated on the calibration of a physically-based, distributed sewer network model and the results are compared with those obtained by NSGA-II, a widely used MOGA.},

Both models were set up using the same horizontal and vertical discretisation and forced by a horizontally resolved wind field. Model simulations were carried out during a stable stratification period in summer. Oscillations of the simulated and the measured isotherms in Lake {\"U}berlingen (north basin of Upper Lake Constance) indicated the existence of a Kelvin-type wave with a period of 84 h. The major wave pattern in period and amplitude was consistent between the simulations and the measurements, whereas discrepancies appeared in the phase match. The measured and the simulated vertical velocity structure in the middle of the main basin of Upper Lake Constance showed occurrence of a Poincar{\'e}-type wave with a 14 h period. Major oscillations of the velocity structure were captured by both models, and the agreement between the simulations and the measurements was higher in deep layers than in near-surface layers. Model prediction of the near-surface velocities as well as the surface circulation pattern was more accurate under high current velocities during strong winds than under weak winds. This study concluded that both ELCOM and Delft3D were significantly skilled at simulating internal wave motions and surface currents, and there was no significant difference in reproducing the measured lake dynamics between ELCOM and Delft3D.},

In this regard, we proposed in this paper, the optimization method of Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt (LM) combined with simulated annealing (SA). The aspect of combination between the two methods is based on the optimal setting of the damping factor of LM at each iteration by SA. The performance of the proposed approach is tested by identifying the model parameters of a 57 mm diameter commercial (R.T.C. France) silicon solar cell. As a result, the developed approach shows its high accuracy when comparing the obtained outcomes with those reported by the other methods in the literature. This effectiveness is proved by the minimal values of statistical errors and the good agreement between the experimental data and the fitted curve. On the other hand, in an attempt to understand the synergy between LM and SA, we firstly studied in detail the behavior of each one and then the impact of their combination on the parameters evolution during the convergence procedure.},

  abstract = {Projected increases in population, income and consumption rates are expected to lead to rising pressure on the land system. Ambitions to limit global warming to 2\,{\textdegree}C or even 1.5\,{\textdegree}C could also lead to additional pressures from land-based mitigation measures such as bioenergy production and afforestation. To investigate these dynamics, this paper describes five elaborations of the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) using the IMAGE 3.0 integrated assessment model framework to produce regional and gridded scenarios up to the year 2100. Additionally, land-based climate change mitigation is modelled aiming for long-term mitigation targets including 1.5\,{\textdegree}C. Results show diverging global trends in agricultural land in the baseline scenarios ranging from an expansion of nearly 826\,Mha in SSP3 to a decrease of more than 305\,Mha in SSP1 for the period 2010{\textendash}2050. Key drivers are population growth, changes in food consumption, and agricultural efficiency. The largest changes take place in Sub-Saharan Africa in SSP3 and SSP4, predominantly due to high population growth. With low increases in agricultural efficiency this leads to expansion of agricultural land and reduced food security. Land use also plays a crucial role in ambitious mitigation scenarios. First, agricultural emissions could form a substantial component of emissions that cannot be fully mitigated. Second, bioenergy and reforestation are crucial to create net negative emissions reducing emissions in SSP2 in 2050 by 8.7 Gt CO2/yr and 1.9 Gt CO2/yr, respectively (1.5\,{\textdegree}C scenario compared to baseline). This is achieved by expansion of bioenergy area (516\,Mha in 2050) and reforestation. Expansion of agriculture for food production is reduced due to REDD policy (290\,Mha in 2050) affecting food security especially in Sub-Saharan Africa indicating an important trade-off of land-based mitigation. This set of SSP land-use scenarios provides a comprehensive quantification of interacting trends in the land system, both socio-economic and biophysical. By providing high resolution data, the scenario output can improve interactions between climate research and impact studies.},

However, rarely does model calibration result in a unique parameter set. Parameter nonuniqueness can lead to predictive nonuniqueness. The extent of model predictive uncertainty should be investigated if management decisions are to be based on model projections. Using models built for four neighboring watersheds in the Neuse River Basin of North Carolina, the application of the automated parameter optimization software PEST in conjunction with the Hydrologic Simulation Program Fortran (HSPF) is demonstrated. Parameter nonuniqueness is illustrated, and a method is presented for calculating many different sets of parameters, all of which acceptably calibrate a watershed model. A regularization methodology is discussed in which models for similar watersheds can be calibrated simultaneously. Using this method, parameter differences between watershed models can be minimized while maintaining fit between model outputs and field observations. In recognition of the fact that parameter nonuniqueness and predictive uncertainty are inherent to the modeling process, PEST's nonlinear predictive analysis functionality is then used to explore the extent of model predictive uncertainty.},

This scheme is a variant of so-called ``Tikhonov regularization'' in which the parameter estimation process is formulated as a constrained minimization problem. Use of the methodology eliminates the need for a modeler to formulate a parsimonious inverse problem in which a handful of parameters are designated for estimation prior to initiating the calibration process. Instead, the level of parameter parsimony required to achieve a stable solution to the inverse problem is determined by the inversion algorithm itself. Where parameters, or combinations of parameters, cannot be uniquely estimated, they are provided with values, or assigned relationships with other parameters, that are decreed to be realistic by the modeler. Conversely, where the information content of a calibration dataset is sufficient to allow estimates to be made of the values of many parameters, the making of such estimates is not precluded by ``preemptive parsimonizing'' ahead of the calibration process.},

In this study, we analysed the capability of a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (EFDC) to capture water temperature and vertical diffusivity in Lake Arendsee in the Northern German plain. Of particular interest to us is to evaluate the model performance for capturing the diffusion minimum within the metalimnion and analyse the response of the metalimnetic Kz to meteorological forcing, namely changing wind speed and warming. The comparison confirmed that the calibrated model could reproduce both stratification dynamics and vertical diffusion profiles in the lake. The model was also shown to be able to capture the duration and vertical extent of the metalimnetic diffusion minimum. The scenario results illustrate that, compared to air temperature, wind velocity appeared to be the more influential meteorological variable on the vertical exchange within the metalimnion. While increasing wind velocities mostly affected the minimum values of Kz in the metalimnion and thus led to intensified vertical exchange, the reduction of wind velocity mostly affected the depth of minimal Kz, but not its absolute value.},

  abstract = {Human impacts such as timber harvesting, channel engineering, beaver removal, and urbanization alter the physical and chemical characteristics of streams. These anthropogenic changes have reduced the number of fallen trees and amount of loose wood that form blockages in streams. Logjams increase hydraulic resistance and create hydraulic head gradients along the streambed that drive groundwater-surface water exchange. Here, we quantify changes in hyporheic exchange flow (HEF) due to a channel-spanning logjam using field measurements and numerical modeling in MODFLOW and MT3DMS. Electrical resistivity (ER) imaging was used to monitor the transport of solutes into the hyporheic zone during a series of in-stream tracer tests supplemented by in-stream monitoring. We conducted experiments in two reaches in Little Beaver Creek, Colorado (USA): one with a single, channel-spanning logjam and the second at a control reach with no logjams. Our results show that 1) higher HEF occurred at the reach with a logjam, 2) logjams created complex HEF pathways that caused bimodal solute breakthrough behavior downstream, and 3) higher discharge rates associated with spring snowmelt increased the extent and magnitude of HEF. Our numerical modeling supported all three field findings, and also suggested that lower flows increased solute retention in streams, although this last conclusion was not supported by field results. This study represents the first use of ER to explore HEF around a naturally occurring logjam over different stream discharges, and has implications for understanding how logjams influence the transport of solutes, the health of stream ecosystems, and stream restoration and conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {In the past few decades, there has been increasing interest in studying various environmental phenomena derived from climate change and its social, environmental, and economic serious impacts. It is particularly critical to developing countries where resources are limited, and conditions may worsen in the midst of environmental disasters caused by soil erosion, leading to indispensable costs in resources and human lives. Since no studies have investigated these implications on a regional scale for the case of Iran, here we assessed the impact of climate change on soil erosion across the country. The RUSLE model was employed to estimate potential soil erosion based on historical climate records and projected future data to assess climate change implications. Daily rainfall data (1987{\textendash}2006) from 103 meteorological stations were used to bias correct the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) rainfall data. Furthermore, CFSR data, as the historical record period data (1987{\textendash}2006), was used for bias correcting five General Circulation Models (GCMs) to develop rainfall erosivity values for the future climate period (2046{\textendash}2065) under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Based on these data sets, rainfall erosivity maps were developed to compare the variations with projected climate results across Iran. Results show an overall decrease in rainfall erosivity and soil erosion in most provinces. Considering the average outputs of five GCMs and under both SSPs, the most affected provinces with projected soil erosion decrease are P.11 and P.14, whereas the highest increase in soil erosion is likely to occur in P.13 by SSP5-8.5. In the northern provinces, particularly in P.7, the highest increase in soil erosion is expected. It was also noted that the highest range of soil erosion change among the five selected GCMs occurs at P.27, with the maximum increase of above 135\% and the minimum decrease of 71\% from the historical period. The present study represents the first assessment of soil erosion at a large scale in Iran, providing an overview of soil erosion that may be useful for soil and water conservation planning, hazard mapping, agriculture, and other activities that are subject to soil erosion.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we synthesize a series of small dam removal studies to examine how changes in channel form can affect riparian vegetation, fish, macroinvertebrates, mussels, and nutrient dynamics. Each of the ecosystem attributes responded to the disturbance of dam removal in different ways and recovered at very different rates, ranging from months to decades. Riparian vegetation appeared to require the greatest time for recovery, while macroinvertebrates had the least. Mussel communities were the most adversely affected group of species and showed no signs of recovery during the time period of the study. Based on these and other studies, we suggest that ecosystems may follow two trajectories of recovery following dam removal. First, ecosystems may fully recover to pre-dam conditions, although this may be unlikely in many cases. Even if full recovery occurs, the timescales over which different attributes recover will vary greatly and may be perceived by the public or management agencies as not recovering at all. Second, ecosystems may only partially recover to pre-dam conditions as the legacy of environmental damage of long-term dam presence may not be reversible or because other watershed changes inhibit full recovery. The potential for full or partial recovery is likely driven by the sensitivity of particular organisms, the characteristics of the dam removed, and the local geomorphic conditions of the watershed. Scientists and management agencies should assess the potential for full or partial recovery prior to dam removal and, in particular, should identify those species or groups of species that are likely to not recover to pre-dam conditions. Such information is critical in the decision of whether, or how, to remove a dam.},

Recently, a global optimization method known as the SCE-UA (shuffled complex evolution method developed at The University of Arizona) has shown promise as an effective and efficient optimization technique for calibrating watershed models. Experience with the method has indicated that the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm are influenced by the choice of the algorithmic parameters. This paper first reviews the essential concepts of the SCE-UA method and then presents the results of several experimental studies in which the National Weather Service river forecast systemsoil moisture accounting (NWSRFS-SMA) model, used by the National Weather Service for river and flood forecasting, was calibrated using different algorithmic parameter setups. On the basis of these results, the recommended values for the algorithmic parameters are given. These values should also help to provide guidelines for other users of the SCE-UA method.},

The dispersion terms arisen from the integration of the product of the discrepancy between the mean and the actual vertical velocity distribution were included in the momentum equations to take into account the effect of secondary current. Two laboratory experimental cases, flow in mildly and sharply curved channels, were selected to test the hydrodynamic model. The comparison of the simulated velocity and water surface elevation with the measurements indicated that the inclusion of the dispersion terms has improved the simulation results. A laboratory experiment study of dye spreading in a sine-generated channel, in which dye was released at the inner bank, centerline, and outer bank, respectively, was chosen to verify the mass transport model. The simulated concentration field indicated that the Schmidt number can be used as a calibration parameter when dispersion is computed using a 2D approach with a simplified turbulence model.},

  abstract = {The inception of channel meandering is the result of the complex interaction between flow, bed sediment, and bank material. A depth-averaged two-dimensional hydrodynamic model is developed to simulate the inception and development of channel meandering processes. The sediment transport model calculates both bedload and suspended load assuming equilibrium sediment transport. Bank erosion consists of two interactive processes: basal erosion and bank failure. Basal erosion is calculated from a newly derived equation for the entrainment of sediment particles by hydrodynamic forces. The mass conservation equation, where basal erosion and bank failure are considered source terms, was solved to obtain the rate of bank erosion. The parallel bank failure model was tested with the laboratory experiments of Friedkin on the initiation and evolution processes of non-cohesive meandering channels. The model replicates the downstream translation and lateral extension of meandering loops reasonably well. Plots of meandering planforms illustrate the evolution of sand bars and redistribution of flow momentum in meandering channels. This numerical modelling study demonstrates the potential of depth-integrated two-dimensional models for the simulation of meandering processes.

  abstract = {Fine sediment represents an important part of the solid flux of rivers. Due to the size of these particles, they are often transported as suspended load. They gradually fill the pores of the substrate forming the hyporheic zone or cover the substrate by settling, resulting in the clogging of the riverbed. Clogging of the major part of the riverbed affects the habitat of invertebrates and reduces the reproduction success of spawning fish. This threat has been reported by a substantial amount of research in the past decades. Human infrastructure (such as reservoirs and hydropower plants), combined with artificial riverbanks and an increased flux of fine sediment in some catchments, has deeply changed the dynamic of rivers. A large number of studies have focused on the impact of clogging on aquatic fauna. The process of deposition of fine sediment has also been the subject of many studies aimed at understanding the role of different parameters (for example, the role of vertical distribution of fine sediment on substrate clogging). Here, the physical mechanisms involved in the deposition of fine sediment are reviewed to give a more comprehensive overview of this complex process. A general description of the process is followed by an analysis of the different parameters that are involved. The influence of flow conditions, substrate composition, hyporheic flow and fine sediment characteristics are analysed in detail. The different models that have been proposed to estimate the depth, quantity and time evolution of the process are also presented. Declogging - the release of fine sediment into the surface flow - is also described according to the existing literature on the subject of fine sediment transport. The clogging process is then reviewed at a larger scale with field aspects that include spatial and temporal parameters linked to flood events, sediment transport, hydropeaking and flushing of reservoirs. Finally, a synthesis of the clogging process is performed together with a dimensional analysis of key elements, followed by a discussion on the research gaps.},

The model system consists of an unsteady hydrodynamic module, a sediment transport module and a bed-deformation module. The hydrodynamic module is based on the two-dimensional shallow water equations. The sediment transport module is comprised of semiempirical models of suspended load and nonequilibrium bedload. The bed-deformation module is based on the mass balance for sediment. The secondary flow transport effects are taken into account by adjusting the dimensionless diffusivity coefficient in the depth-average version of the k {\textendash} ␧ turbulence model. A quasi-three-dimensional flow approach is used to simulate the effect of secondary flows due to channel curvature on bed-load transport. The effects of bed slope on the rate and direction of bed-load transport are also taken into account. The developed model has been validated by computing the scour hole and the deposition dune produced by a jet discharged into a shallow pool with movable bed. Two further applications of the model are presented in which the bed deformation is calculated in curved alluvial channels under steady- and unsteady-flow conditions. The predictions are compared with data from laboratory measurements. Generally good agreement is obtained.},

Convolution of several inputs with uniform uncertainty leads to bell-shaped Gaussian-like uncertainty functions. Relations between input uncertainties and fuzzy rules are systematically explored and several new types of MFs discovered. Multilayered perceptron (MLP) networks are shown to be a particular implementation of hierarchical sets of fuzzy threshold logic rules based on sigmoidal MFs. They are equivalent to crisp logical networks applied to input data with uncertainty. Leaving fuzziness on the input side makes the networks or the rule systems easier to understand. Practical applications of these ideas are presented for analysis of questionnaire data and gene expression data.},

  abstract = {The quantification of greenhouse gas emissions from aquatic ecosystems requires knowledge about the spatial and temporal dynamics of free gas in sediments. Freezing the sediment in situ offers a promising method for obtaining gas-bearing sediment samples, unaffected by changes in hydrostatic pressure and sample temperature during core withdrawal and subsequent analysis. This article presents a novel freeze coring technique to preserve the in situ stratigraphy and gas bubble characteristics. Nondestructive X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans were used to identify and characterize coring disturbances of gravity and freeze cores associated with gassy sediment, as well as the effect of the freezing process on the gas bubble characteristics. Real-time X-ray CT scans were conducted to visualize the progression of the freezing process. Additional experiments were conducted to determine the freezing rate to assess the probability of sediment particle/bubble migration, and gas bubble nucleation at the phase transition of pore water to ice. The performance of the freeze coring technique was evaluated under field conditions in Olsberg and Urft Reservoir (Germany). The results demonstrate the capability of the freeze coring technique for the preservation of gas-bearing sediments and the analysis of gas bubble distribution pattern in both reservoirs. Nevertheless, the obtained cores showed that nearly all gravity and freeze cores show some degree of coring disturbances.},

  abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems with organic-rich sediments are a globally significant source of methane to the atmosphere. In shallow waters, ebullition is often a dominant emission pathway of methane. Current knowledge on the processes controlling gas bubble formation and persistence in aquatic sediments is limited. An important prerequisite for accurate quantification of the structure and methane bubbles in sediment samples is to preserve the ambient in situ conditions during the withdrawal process and further analysis. A novel freeze corer has been developed that facilitates sampling of gas-bearing soft sediments for X-ray computer tomography. The sampler allows freezing sediment inside a double-walled corer with a mixture of dry ice and ethanol. This corer has moderate costs and offers important advantages for gassy sediment sampling. Its simplicity and robustness allow to perform sampling from a small boat and the ability to characterize in situ sediment features. The applicability of this freeze coring technique for gas bubble quantification was validated during laboratory experiments aimed to investigate the effects of freezing on sediment gas content, bubble size distribution, and their geometry by comparing computer tomography scans of unfrozen vs. frozen cores. The performance of the corer was further evaluated during field conditions in Lake Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee, Israel). The results demonstrate the suitability of the freeze-coring method for in situ preservation of gas-bearing sediments. The sediment structure, however, showed some displacements of sediments layers and bubble abundance in some core regions. Future investigations are needed to address the nature of disturbances of the frozen sediment.},

For a large lateral expansion ratio, the use of two protocols of simulation highlighted a high sensitivity of the simulated flow pattern to the initial condition. Comparison between simulated results and experimental data showed a good agreement for the critical shape parameter (combination of the lateral expansion ratio and the dimensionless length) between symmetric and asymmetric flows. A good agreement was also found for the value of the shorter reattachment length of asymmetric flows. For small lateral expansion ratios, the agreement was not so good. The model was used for even larger lateral expansion ratios in order to numerically extend the experimental dataset. This predictive work showed that the shape parameter, whose expression was only based on experiments carried out for small lateral expansion ratios, was also relevant for larger values.

Computer models describing the preferences of fish for hydraulic microhabitats have been applied to environmental flow problems since the mid-1970s. Salmonids have been a particular focus for these methods. Other reviews have provided comprehensive coverage of the basic features and principles of such models. These are briefly discussed focusing on the developments that have occurred in the last 15 years and whose application has so far been infrequent. These include improvements to the representation of hydraulics at reach-scale and of longer river sections, and improved representation of interacting physical variables that describe habitat. The central theme is the spatial coverage and fundamental granularity of such models. Despite a broad literature, there is a lack of documented examples of the application of hydraulic-habitat models through all stages in the environmental flow decision-making process. The review concludes with four short examples that illustrate the use of model output.},

This has mainly two reasons: the lack of appropriate data and the large computational demand in terms of CPU-time. Both aspects are aggravated in large-scale applications. However, there are recent developments that improve the situation on both the data and computing side. Remote sensing, especially radarbased techniques proved to provide highly valuable information on flood extents, and in case high precision DEMs are present, also on spatially distributed inundation depths. On the computing side the use of parallelization techniques brought significant performance gains. In the presented study we build on these developments by calibrating a large-scale 1-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the whole Mekong Delta downstream of Kratie in Cambodia: we combined insitu data from a network of river gauging stations, i.e. data with high temporal but low spatial resolution, with a series of inundation maps derived from ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) satellite images, i.e. data with low temporal but high spatial resolution, in an multiobjective automatic calibration process. It is shown that an automatic, multi-objective calibration of hydrodynamic models, even of such complexity and on a large scale and complex as a model for the Mekong Delta, is possible. Furthermore, the calibration process revealed model deficiencies in the model structure, i.e. the representation of the dike system in Vietnam, which would have been difficult to detect by a standard manual calibration procedure.},

  abstract = {Wildfire danger and burnt areas should increase over the century in southern Europe, owing to climate warming. Fire-prone area expansion to the north and to Mediterranean mountains is a concern, while climate-induced burnt area increase might be limited by fuel availability in the most arid areas. Further studies are needed to both assess and reduce uncertainties on future trends. Wildfire is the main disturbance in forested ecosystems of southern Europe. Warmer and drier conditions projected in this region are expected to profoundly affect wildfire regimes. In this review, we pursue a twofold objective: (i) report the trends in wildfire danger and activity projected under warming climate in southern Europe and (ii) discuss the limitations of these projections. We reviewed 23 projection studies that examined future wildfire danger or wildfire activity at local, regional or continental scale. Under the scenarios with the highest greenhouse gas emissions, we found that projection studies estimate an increase in future fire danger and burnt areas varying, on average, from 2 to 4\% and from 5 to 50\% per decade, respectively. Further comparisons on the magnitude of increase remained challenging because of heterogeneous methodological choices between projection studies. We then described three main sources of uncertainty that may affect the reliability of wildfire projections: climate projections, climate-fire models and the influences of fuels, fire-vegetation feedbacks and human-related factors on the climate-fire relationships. We suggest research directions to address some of these issues for the purpose of refining fire danger and fire activity projections in southern Europe.},

  abstract = {Construction of dams causes reduced flow velocities, inducing gradual deposition of sediments carried by the inflowing stream, and resulting in sedimentation and ultimately diminishing reservoir storage capacity. This study focuses on sedimentation of Hirakud Reservoir in Odisha, India, using available reservoir capacity and numerical simulation data. Reduced trap efficiency, observed and projected capacity curves, rising reservoir bed level and the capacities of the different storage zones for various projected years are analysed. The area-reduction method indicates the loss in the live, gross and dead storage will be 58\%, 63\% and 100\%, respectively, of their original capacities by 2057, which represents 100 years of impounding of water in the reservoir. If the present sediment inflow rate continues without regular flushing of the deposited sediment, it is predicted the reservoir bed level will rise to the full reservoir level of 192.02 m by the year 2110. Brune's trap efficiency and step method indicate the gross storage zone of Hirakud Reservoir will be completely depleted by the end of 2110, with the trap efficiency reduced to zero. The empirical area-reduction method is found to be more suitable for determining the storage capacities of Hirakud Reservoir in the absence of sedimentation survey data. An attempt was also made to solve the combined hydrodynamic and sediment transport equations numerically to predict morphological changes in Hirakud Reservoir. The finite-element code TELEMAC-2D and finite-volume code for SISYPHE, respectively, were applied to solve the above set of equations in order to predict the bed profiles at different reservoir cross sections for the period of 1958{\textendash}2008. Analysis of the simulated results demonstrates that, considering the model inputs, the model performs well in simulating the morphology and dynamic characteristics of a reservoir. Projection of the numerical results indicates a complete loss of reservoir operational life due to sedimentation by around 2150.},

Seventy-eight years ago, Cook was the first to identify mathematically, the three major factors affecting soil erosion in the catchment of a reservoir. As sedimentation is dependent on sediment yield and sediment yield depends on soil erosion, it is required to predict all three parameters to estimate the life of a reservoir. Since then many researchers carried their research dealing with soil erosion, sediment yield and sedimentation in various reservoirs for its practical significance. The aim of this article is to present a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the important investigations on soil erosion, sediment yield and sedimentation in various reservoirs highlighting the governing mathematical background of these problems. 198 references are included in this review paper.},

  abstract = {Hirakud, the longest earthen dam in Asia on the river Mahanadi, has been affected by sedimentation problems which affect reservoir storage capacities and different reservoir operations. This article presents the hydrological modeling of the Mahanadi catchment up to Hirakud, located in the states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha in India, using the modified version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with an interface of ArcView Geographic Information System software to predict soil erosion and sediment transport to the reservoir for improving its useful life. The data sources used in the study were: terrain data 90~m resolution of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, Land Use and Land Cover derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, soil map published by National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning, India and meteorological data collected from India Meteorological Department, India. The study involves the analysis of sensitive parameters of the simulated data (discharge 15, sediment load 6); 5-year calibration and 3-year validation on daily basis to predict the discharge and sediment load. The sensitivity analysis was carried out using the Latin Hypercube and One-factor-At-a-Time. The results also show that the prediction of sediment yield is highly sensitive to the sizes of different sub-basins due to the sensitivity of topographic factors used in the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation. The graphical as well as statistical results achieved in this study indicate that the model is capable to identify critical erosion-prone areas within the watershed on the scale of sub-watershed which helps the hydrologists to introduce effective management practices at the lowest cost. The study shows that about 34\% area of total catchment falls under high or above soil erosion zones with combination of coarse loamy type of soil and agricultural type of land use and land cover condition. The results of this study also identify regions of high sediment yield and sediment delivery ratio. To enhance the SWAT model performance, it is recommended to use sub-daily data and to prioritize soil erosion at the Hydrological Response Units level for improvement of watershed management.},

The low-density macroflocs (diameter {$>\sim$}150 {$\mu$}m) contain a mixture of organic and inorganic constituents that become separated when the flocs are disrupted to form microflocs. Representation of the floc characteristics in terms of fractals reveals a range of fractal dimensions representing the distributions varying between 1 and 3, instead of the ideal value of 2. Measurements in estuarine turbidity maxima and on intertidal mudflats show that the fractal dimension is less than 2 in situations where turbulent shearing causes disruption of the flocs. At the same time increasing suspended sediment concentration tends to increase the fractal dimension. Measurements of size using an in situ Malvern sizer show that the floc size distribution is also affected by both turbulent energy dissipation and by concentration. Complementary laboratory studies suggest that, at a constant concentration, flocculation is enhanced by low shear, but that disruption occurs at higher shear. These experiments confirm the relationship between fractal dimension, shear stress and concentration.},

The base software for modeling of river processes was the well-known and widely used HEC-RAS. The concepts were tested on two models created for a single reach of the Warta river located in the central part of Poland. The ideas described were illustrated with three examples. The first was a basic simulation of a steady flow run from the Python script. The second example presented automatic calibration of model roughness coefficients with Nelder-Mead simplex from the SciPy module. In the third example, the sediment transport was controlled by Python script. Sediment samples were accessed and changed in the sediment data file stored in XML format. The results of the sediment simulation were read from HDF5 files. The presented techniques showed good effectiveness of this approach. The paper compared the developed techniques with other, earlier approaches to control of HEC-RAS computations. Possible further developments were also discussed.},

Legends for each of the derived datasets are listed in the Appendix of the GLCC README. All GLCC data is available in two forms: GLCC (by continent) provides the GLCC classifications, as well as monthly NDVI composites, on a continent-by-continent basis (Africa, North America, South America, Eurasia, and Australia/Pacific). The continent GLCC data is available in the Interrupted Goode Homolosine or in the Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area projection. Nominal spatial resolution is 1 kilometer. GLCC (global) data consists of the continent GLCC datasets which have been combined to produce a set of global GLCC composites. The global data is available in either the Interrupted Goode Homolosine or in geographic (latitude/longitude) coordinates. Nominal spatial resolution is 1 kilometer. For every GLCC dataset, there are two versions available. Version 1 consists of GLCC data which has undergone complete accuracy assessment. Version 2 is updated GLCC which reflects additional data and sources, but accuracy assessment has not been completed.}

Here, we present a novel soil erosion model ensemble to assess model uncertainty in climate-change impact assessments. The model ensemble consists of five continuous process-based soil erosion models that run at a daily time step (i.e., DHSVM, HSPF, INCA, MMF, SHETRAN). The models were implemented in the SPHY hydrological model and simulate detachment by raindrop impact, detachment by runoff, and immediate deposition. The soil erosion model ensemble was applied in a semiarid catchment in the southeast of Spain. We applied three future climate scenarios based on global mean temperature rise (+1.5, +2 and +3{\textdegree}C). Data from two contrasting regional climate models were used to assess how an increase and a decrease in projected extreme precipitation affect model uncertainty. Soil loss is projected to increase (up to 95\%) and decrease (up to -30\%) under climate change, mostly reflecting the change in extreme precipitation. Model uncertainty is found to increase with increasing slope, extreme precipitation and runoff, which reveals some inherent differences in model assumptions among the five models. Moreover, the model uncertainty increases in all climate change scenarios, independent of the projected change in annual precipitation and extreme precipitation. This stresses the importance to consider model uncertainty through model ensembles of climate, hydrology, and soil erosion in climate-change impact assessments.},

Through a systematic review of 224 modelling studies, we provide a global assessment of the impact of climate change on soil erosion and the adaptation potential through land use change and soil conservation. We account for the robustness of each study based on a statistical analysis of ten methodological aspects and an expert consultation. Results show a global increasing trend in soil erosion towards the end of the 21st century, with the highest increase projected in semi-arid regions. Land use change characterized by agricultural expansion and deforestation aggravate the impact. Reforestation, agricultural land abandonment and soil conservation practices can entirely compensate the impact of climate change on soil erosion. This stresses the need for soil conservation and integrated land use planning. From the obtained weights per study we can conclude that there is a lot of uncertainty in the methods applied, without a clear trend towards more robust studies. Based on the results of the expert consultation, we recommend to use a climate model ensemble of at least five climate models, based on the latest CMIP6 climate scenarios. These data should be downscaled and bias corrected using trend preserving quantile methods. Finally, the post-processed climate data should be applied in a soil erosion model forced by precipitation and runoff. Considering the most robust methodologies of the different aspects of the uncertainty cascade will lead to better spatial evaluation of the impact of climate change on soil erosion and identification of most effective adaptation strategies.},

  abstract = {One decade after the first publications on multi-objective calibration of hydrological models, we summarize the experience gained so far by underlining the key perspectives offered by such approaches to improve parameter identification. After reviewing the fundamentals of vector optimization theory and the algorithmic issues, we link the multi-criteria calibration approach with the concepts of uncertainty and equifinality. Specifically, the multi-criteria framework enables recognition and handling of errors and uncertainties, and detection of prominent behavioural solutions with acceptable trade-offs. Particularly in models of complex parameterization, a multiobjective approach becomes essential for improving the identifiability of parameters and augmenting the information contained in calibration by means of both multi-response measurements and empirical metrics (``soft'' data), which account for the hydrological expertise. Based on the literature review, we also provide alternative techniques for dealing with conflicting and non-commeasurable criteria, and hybrid strategies to utilize the information gained towards identifying promising compromise solutions that ensure consistent and reliable calibrations.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this study is to apply the RUSLE to the Venetikos River catchment, located at Western Macedonia, Northern Greece, in order to estimate soil erosion and investigate its spatial distribution. The model was implemented in a GIS environment, taking into account the spatial variation of its individual factors. Sediment yield resulted by applying the sediment delivery ratio (SDR), calculated by the empirical Renfro (1972) equation, to the initially estimated gross erosion. The model's performance was evaluated, both annually and inter-annually, considering the sediment discharge measurements conducted by the Greek Public Power Corporation (PPC) at the catchment's outlet, namely Grevena Bridge, during the time period 1965-1982. The simulated results were underestimated compared to the observed ones, a fact attributed to the model's inherent limitations (e.g. questionable performance on catchment scale implementation, estimation of inter-rill and rill erosion but not of gully or streamchannel erosion etc.), as well as the catchment's specific characteristics (e.g. mainly mountainous with limited agricultural areas to which the model performs better, extensive vegetation cover, relatively low precipitation erosivity, bed rock not prone to erosion, rainfall{\textendash}geological characteristics{\textendash}topography{\textendash}land cover pattern combinations that do not allow high erosion rates). Overall, despite underestimating the observed results, the RUSLE model performed quite satisfactory and allowed identification of the most susceptible to erosion areas, constituting an important predictive tool for soil and environmental management in this region.},

  abstract = {Observed changes in precipitation patterns, rising surface temperature, increases in frequency and intensity of floods and droughts, widespread melting of ice, and reduced snow cover are some of the documented hydrologic changes associated with global climate change. Climate change is therefore expected to affect the water supply-demand balance in the Northeast United States and challenge existing water management strategies. The hydrological implications of future climate will affect the design capacity and operating characteristics of dams. The vulnerability of water resources systems to floods and droughts will increase, and the trade-offs between reservoir releases to maintain flood control storage, drought resilience, ecological flow, human water demand, and energy production should be reconsidered. We used a Neural Networks based General Reservoir Operation Scheme to estimate the implications of climate change for dams on a regional scale. This dynamic daily reservoir module automatically adapts to changes in climate and re-adjusts the operation of dams based on water storage level, timing, and magnitude of incoming flows. Our findings suggest that the importance of dams in providing water security in the region will increase. We create an indicator of the Effective Degree of Regulation (EDR) by dams on water resources and show that it is expected to increase, particularly during drier months of year, simply as a consequence of projected climate change. The results also indicate that increasing the size and number of dams, in addition to modifying their operations, may become necessary to offset the vulnerabilities of water resources systems to future climate uncertainties. This is the case even without considering the likely increase in future water demand, especially in the most densely populated regions of the Northeast.},

A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false.

A brief description of each algorithm is presented along with a pseudocode to facilitate the implementation and use of such algorithms by researchers and practitioners. Benchmark comparisons among the algorithms are presented for both continuous and discrete optimization problems, in terms of processing time, convergence speed, and quality of the results. Based on this comparative analysis, the performance of EAs is discussed along with some guidelines for determining the best operators for each algorithm.

  abstract = {Bank erosion can be an important form of morphological adjustment in rivers. With the advances made in computational techniques, two-dimensional (2D) depth-averaged numerical models have become valuable tools for resolving many engineering problems dealing with sediment transport. The objective of this research work is to present a simple, new, bank-erosion operator that is integrated into a 2D Saint-VenantExner morphodynamic model. The numerical code is based on an unstructured grid of triangular elements and finite-element algorithms. The slope of each element in the grid is compared to the angle of repose of the bank material. Elements for which the slope is too steep are tilted to bring them to the angle of repose along a horizontal axis defined such that the volume loss above the axis is equal to the volume gain below, thus ensuring mass balance. The model performance is assessed using data from laboratory flume experiments and a scale model of the Old Rhine. For the flume experiment case with uniform bank material, relevant results are obtained for bank geometry changes. For the more challenging case (i.e. scale model of the Old Rhine with non-uniform bank material), the numerical model is capable of reproducing the main features of the bank failure, induced by the newly designed groynes, as well as the transport of the mobilized sediment material downstream. Some deviations between the computed results and measured data are, however, observed. They are ascribed to the effects of three-dimensional (3D) flow structures, pore pressure and cohesion, which are not considered in the present 2D model.},

Most components of the Manning formula can currently be derived from spaceborne products except for two features: the unobserved always-wet bathymetry and the roughness coefficient. Global-scale applications use simplified equivalent riverbed shapes and empirical parameters while local-scale applications rely on finer model dynamics, field survey and expert knowledge. Within the framework of the incoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, scheduled for a launch in 2022, and more particularly, the development of the SWOT-based discharge product, fine-resolution but global discharge estimates should be produced. Currently implemented SWOT-based discharge algorithms require prior information on bathymetry and roughness and their performances highly depend on the quality of such priors. Here we introduce an automatic and spaceborne-data-based-only methodology to derive physically-based roughness coefficients to use in one-dimensional hydrological models. The evaluation of those friction coefficients showed that they allow model performances comparable to calibrated models. Finally, we illutrate two cases of application where our roughness coefficients are used as-is to initiate the experiment: a data assimilation experiment designed to correct the roughness parameters and an application around the HiVDI SWOT-based discharge algorithm. In both cases, the roughness coefficients showed promising perspectives by reproducing, for the data assimilation application, and sometimes improving, in the SWOT discharge algorithm case, the calibrated-parameter-based performances.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, based on our very large data set on CH4 distributions within lakes, we demonstrate here that methane-enriched water from shallow water zones is the most likely source of the basin-wide mean CH4 concentrations in the surface water of lakes. Consistently, the mean surface CH4 concentrations are significantly correlated with the ratio between the surface area of the shallow water zone and the entire lake, fA,s/t, but not with the total surface area. The categorization of CH4 fluxes according to fA,s/t may therefore improve global estimates of CH4 emissions from lakes. Furthermore, CH4 concentrations increase substantially with water temperature, indicating that seasonally resolved data are required to accurately estimate annual CH4 emissions.},

At present, the interaction among spatial patterns of mean flow, turbulence, bed morphology, bank failures and channel migration in compound loops is poorly understood. In particular, field studies of this interaction over the timescale of planform evolution are lacking. This study examines the co-evolution of flow, bed morphology, and channel planform in a compound meander loop and relates patterns of near-bank velocity and turbulence to planform change within the loop. Data consist of repeat surveys of channel change in a compound loop over an 11-year period, coupled with Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) measurements of 3-D instantaneous velocities for similar magnitude flows at the beginning and end of this period. Results confirm that this compound loop is highly dynamic, with major changes in planform occurring over the 11-year period. Spatial patterns of near-bank velocity and turbulence correspond to patterns of bank erosion and channel migration within the loop; however, these patterns are not strictly a function of planform curvature. Instead, local factors, including deflection of the flow by point bars and failed bank blocks, enhance or inhibit the development of high near-bank velocities and turbulence kinetic energy. The loop has elongated and become more asymmetric over time{\textemdash}a pattern of development consistent with patterns of near-bank velocities and turbulence at the beginning of the study period. The pattern of near-bank velocities and turbulence for measurements at the end of the period indicate that the loop will continue to elongate in the near future, supporting the hypothesis that compound loops evolve continuously over time rather than developing into a stable configuration.},

This study uses high-frequency measurements of flow velocities to analyze the characteristics of turbulence in close proximity to the outer bank of an actively migrating compound meander bend. Results show that the structure of turbulence in the bend is linked to curvatureinduced effects through the progressive advection of high momentum fluid toward the outer bank as flow moves through the bend. Vertical profiles of streamwise-vertical Reynolds stresses near the outer bank differ considerably from those in wide straight channels because of the effects both of curvature-induced helical motion and of local frictional effects associated with the complex bank morphology.

Next, the problem of flow in a meandering channel with fixed side walls has been investigated, using a special system of curvilinear coordinates. The solution of the linearized flow equations yields a method for calculation of the distribution of the bed shear stress. In the first approximation the large-scale bottom geometry is calculated by considering the lateral sediment balance.

By means of an open-source Navier-Stokes solver and the derived self-similarity conditions, we demonstrated self-similarity within the time variation of flow dynamics for a rigid-lid cavity problem under both up-scaled and down-scaled domains. The strength of the proposed approach lies in its ability to consider the underlying flow dynamics through not only from the governing equations under consideration but also from the initial and boundary conditions, hence allowing to obtain perfect self-similarity in different time and space scales. The proposed methodology can be a valuable tool in obtaining self-similar flow dynamics under preferred level of detail, which can be represented by initial and boundary value problems under specific assumptions.},

  abstract = {A sediment mass balance constructed for a 16-km reach of the Snake River downstream from Jackson Lake Dam (JLD) indicates that river regulation has reduced the magnitude of sediment mass balance deficit that would naturally exist in the absence of the dam. The sediment budget was constructed from calibrated bed load transport relations, which were used to model sediment flux into and through the study reach. Calibration of the transport relations was based on bed load transport data collected over a wide range of flows on the Snake River and its two major tributaries within the study area in 2006 and 2007. Comparison of actual flows with unregulated flows for the period since 1957 shows that operations of JLD have reduced annual peak flows and increased late summer flows. Painted tracer stones placed at five locations during the 2005 spring flood demonstrate that despite the reduction in flood magnitudes, common floods are capable of mobilizing the bed material. The sediment mass balance demonstrates that more sediment exits the study reach than is being supplied by tributaries. However, the volume of sediment exported using estimated unregulated hydrology indicates that the magnitude of the deficit would be greater in the absence of JLD. Calculations suggest that the Snake River was not in equilibrium before construction of JLD, but was naturally in sediment deficit. The conclusion that impoundment lessened a natural sediment deficit condition rather than causing sediment surplus could not have been predicted in the absence of sediment transport data, and highlights the value of transport data and calculation of sediment mass balance in informing dam operations.

  abstract = {While the history of a fluvial hydrosystem can provide essential knowledge on present functioning, historical context remains rarely considered in river restoration. Here we show the relevance of an interdisciplinary study for improving restoration within the framework of a European LIFE+ project on the French side of the Upper Rhine (Rohrschollen Island). Investigating the planimetric evolution combined with historical high-flow data enabled us to reconstruct pre-disturbance hydromorphological functioning and major changes that occurred on the reach. A deposition frequency assessment combining vertical evolution of the Rhine thalweg, chronology of deposits in the floodplain, and a hydrological model revealed that the period of incision in the main channel corresponded to high rates of narrowing and lateral channel filling. Analysis of filling processes using Passega diagrams and IRSL dating highlights that periods of engineering works were closely related to fine sediment deposition, which also presents concomitant heavy metal accumulation. In fact, current fluvial forms, processes and sediment chemistry around Rohrschollen Island directly reflect the disturbances that occurred during past correction works, and up to today. Our results underscore the advantage of combining functional restoration with detailed knowledge of the past trajectory to (i) understand the functioning of the hydrosystem prior to anthropogenic disturbances, (ii) characterize the human-driven morphodynamic adjustments during the last 2 centuries, (iii) characterize physico-chemical sediment properties to trace anthropogenic activities and evaluate the potential impact of the restoration on pollutant remobilization, (iv) deduce the post-restoration evolution tendency and (v) evaluate the efficiency and sustainability of the restoration effects. We anticipate our approach will expand the toolbox of decision-makers and help orientate functional restoration actions in the future.},

In the present study a fully three-dimensional numerical model SSIIM that employs the Finite Volume Approach (FVM) was utilized to reproduce the 3D flow field. Various shallow reservoir geometries with fixed and deformed equilibrium bed were considered. The measurements by Large-Scale Particle Image Velocimetry techniques (LSPIV) and Ultrasonic Doppler Velocity Profiler (UVP) over the flow depth were used for model validation. Outcomes revealed reasonable agreement between the simulated and measured flow velocity field even when an asymmetric flow pattern exists in the reservoir.},

The flushing channel evolution procedure is a complex phenomenon especially in steep reservoirs owing to the dynamic interaction between the unsteady flow field and bed variations. The flushing channel formation and evolution procedure were investigated in meandering channel of Dashidaira reservoir utilizing the field measurements and numerical simulations. A 3D numerical model which applies the Finite Volume Method (FVM) in combination with a wetting/drying algorithm was used together with different bed load transport formulas. The numericaloutcomes disclosed reasonable agreement with the field measurements. In addition, a further insight in the correlation between the flushed out sediment discharge and the water discharge as well as the water level was found.},

  abstract = {Data clustering is one of the most popular techniques in data mining. It is a process of partitioning an unlabeled dataset into groups, where each group contains objects which are similar to each other with respect to a certain similarity measure and different from those of other groups. Clustering high-dimensional data is the cluster analysis of data which have anywhere from a few dozen to many thousands of dimensions. Such high-dimensional data spaces are often encountered in areas such as medicine, bioinformatics, biology, recommendation systems and the clustering of text documents. Many algorithms for large data sets have been proposed in the literature using different techniques. However, conventional algorithms have some shortcomings such as the slowness of their convergence and their sensitivity to initialization values. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-based globalized search algorithm that uses the principles of the social behavior of swarms. PSO produces better results in complicated and multi-peak problems. This paper presents a literature survey on the PSO algorithm and its variants to clustering high-dimensional data. An attempt is made to provide a guide for the researchers who are working in the area of PSO and high-dimensional data clustering.},

Often, empirically based models are preferred due to low data requirements, simplicity and clarity. Yet, uncertainty produced by local context or parameter estimation remains poorly quantified and documented. We assessed model uncertainty of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation {\textendash} RUSLE developed mainly from US data. RUSLE is the most commonly applied model to assess watershed-level soil loss. We performed a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) on RUSLE with four dissimilar datasets to understand uncertainty and to provide recommendations for data collection and model parameterization. The datasets cover varying spatial levels (plot, watershed and continental) and environmental conditions (temperate and tropical). We found cover management and topography create the most uncertainty regardless of environmental conditions or data parameterization techniques. The importance of other RUSLE factors varies across contexts. We argue that model uncertainty could be reduced through better parameterization of cover management and topography factors while avoiding severe soil losses by targeting soil conservation practices in areas where both factors interact and enhance soil loss. We recommend incorporating GSA to assess empirical models' uncertainty, to guide model parameterization and to target soil conservation efforts.},

In the citizen science project CrowdWater, repeated water level observations using a virtual staff gauge approach result in time series of water level classes (WL-classes). To investigate the quality of these observations, we compared the WL-class data with ``real'' (i.e., measured) water levels from the same stream at a nearby gauging station. We did this for nine locations where citizen scientists reported multiple observations using a smartphone app and at 12 locations where signposts were set up to ask citizens to record observations on a paper form that could be left in a letterbox. The results indicate that the quality of the data collected with the app was better than for the forms. A possible explanation is that for each app location, a single person submitted the vast majority of the observations, whereas at the locations of the forms almost every observation was made by a different person. On average, there were more contributions between May and September than during the other months. Observations were submitted for a range of flow conditions, with a higher fraction of high flow observations for the locations were data were collected with the app. Overall, the results are encouraging for citizen science approaches in hydrology and demonstrate that the smartphone application and the virtual staff gauge are a promising approach for crowd-based water level class observations.},

  abstract = {Only three biological pathways are known to produce oxygen: photosynthesis, chlorate respiration and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Here we present evidence for a fourth pathway, possibly of considerable geochemical and evolutionary importance. The pathway was discovered after metagenomic sequencing of an enrichment culture that couples anaerobic oxidation of methane with the reduction of nitrite to dinitrogen. The complete genome of the dominant bacterium, named `Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera', was assembled. This apparently anaerobic, denitrifying bacterium encoded, transcribed and expressed the well-established aerobic pathway for methane oxidation, whereas it lacked known genes for dinitrogen production. Subsequent isotopic labelling indicated that `M. oxyfera' bypassed the denitrification intermediate nitrous oxide by the conversion of two nitric oxide molecules to dinitrogen and oxygen, which was used to oxidize methane. These results extend our understanding of hydrocarbon degradation under anoxic conditions and explain the biochemical mechanism of a poorly understood freshwater methane sink. Because nitrogen oxides were already present on early Earth, our finding opens up the possibility that oxygen was available to microbial metabolism before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Calibration of parameters of mathematical models is still a tough task in several engineering problems. Many of the models adopted for the numerical simulations of real phenomena, in fact, are of empirical derivation. Therefore, they include parameters which have to be calibrated in order to correctly reproduce the physical evidence. Thus, the success of a numerical model application depends on the quality of the performed calibration, which can be of great complexity, especially if the number of parameters is higher than one. Calibration is traditionally performed by engineers and researchers through manual trial-and-error procedures. However, since models themselves are increasingly sophisticated, it seems more proper to look at more advanced calibration procedures. In this work, in particular, an optimization technique for a multi-parameter calibration is applied to a two-phase depth-averaged model, already adopted in previous works to simulate morphodynamic processes, such as, for example, the dike erosion by overtopping.},

  abstract = {This study presents the differences and similarities between the MODFLOW-USG (Unstructured Grid version of MODFLOW) and traditional structured versions of MODFLOW 2005 in simulating a three-dimensional multilayer groundwater flow model in Quaternary aquifer east Nile delta in Egypt. A 390-borehole dataset was used to build a three-dimension stratigraphic model of the Quaternary aquifer. GIS-based conceptual model is mapping to represent the different boundary conditions such as lakes, river, drains, aquifer recharge, and discharge. The conceptual model is exported to the stratigraphic model; therefore, boundary conditions data are automatically arranged in arrays identical with the grid cells. MODFLOW 2005 and MODFLOW USG are combined with the computer-based program PEST to calibrate groundwater head distribution through the aquifer system. Groundwater levels measured in 1991 are used for the steady-state calibration and are employed then as initial conditions for the transient calibration between 1991 and 2004. The heads measured in 2015 are used for more model verification. The results show that MODFLOW-USG provides flexibility in grid design, including the capability to use nonrectangular cell shapes. Also, it can be used with simple grids and nested grids that allow for the solution to be focused in areas of interest. Also, the results show that the MODFLOW-2005 simulation takes about 20 times longer to complete the run and uses about 6 times more cells number than the MODFLOW-USG simulation.},

  abstract = {MIKE SHE is a physically based, integrated water resources model that simulates both surface and subsurface water dynamics. These dynamics include interception, evapotranspiration, overland flow, channel flow, unsaturated flow, and saturated zone flow. The model can also simulate limited surface water quality processes using the advection dispersion equation and groundwater quality with a random-walk tracking method. This article is intended to describe the components of MIKE SHE and its calibration, validation, and applications. Given the deterministic, physically based characteristics of MIKE SHE and the large number of processes it simulates simultaneously, the number of parameters to calibrate can be large. A combination of user experience with the model, knowledge of the problem being solved, and an automatic calibration feature help in selecting the most sensitive parameters to calibrate. A case study describing the use of the MIKE SHE model, coupled with the hydraulic MIKE 11 model, to solve water flow in agricultural reservoirs in south Florida is presented. The problem required the use of the MIKE SHE model due to the high groundwater and overland flow interactions as well as the complex flow patterns inside the reservoir. The horizontal and vertical saturated hydraulic conductivities and the leakage coefficient were identified as the calibration parameters. The model was calibrated and evaluated for two reservoirs using two different time periods. Results showed matching between measured and simulated data for both reservoirs for the calibration and validation periods. The coupled MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 model has the capabilities to simulate complex hydrological processes and their interactions, which few other watershed models can match, and is suitable for current problems, such as the effects of climate change and land use change.},

It proposes a randomization test that enables one to assess the statistical significance of each component that enters the model. This alternative is compared with cross-validation and independent test set validation for the calibration of a near-infrared spectral data set using partial least squares (PLS) regression. The results indicate that the alternative approach is more objective, since, unlike the validation-based approach, it does not require the use of `soft' decision rules. The alternative approach therefore appears to be a useful addition to the chemometrician's toolbox.},

This study aims to investigate the potential use of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), water quality and remote sensing data to calibrate and validate a large-scale sediment model. Observed data from across 108 stations located in the Doce River basin was used for the period between 1997-2010. Ten calibration and validation experiments using the MOCOM-UA optimization algorithm coupled with the MGB-SED model were carried out, which, over the same period of time, resulted in 37 calibration and 111 validation tests. The experiments were performed by modifying metrics, spatial discretization, observed data and parameters of the MOCOM-UA algorithm. Results generally demonstrated that the values of correlation presented slight variations and were superior in the calibration step. Additionally, increasing spatial discretization or establishing a background concentration for the model allowed for improved results. In a station with high quantity of SSC data, calibration improved the ENS coefficient from -0.44 to 0.44. The experiments showed that the spectral surface reflectance, total suspended solids and turbidity data have the potential to enhance the performance of sediment models.}

A warmer climate with more frequent and intense extremes could result in supply reliability issues. Here, (i) a robust framework to highlight the interdependencies between hydropower, water availability, and climate change is proposed, (ii) the state-of-the art literature on the projected impacts of climate change on hydropower in sub-Saharan Africa is reviewed, and (iii) supporting evidence on past trends and current pathways of power mix diversification, drought incidence, and climate change projections is provided. We find that only few countries have pursued a diversification strategy away from hydropower over the last three decades, while others' expansion plans will reinforce the dependency. This will occur irrespective of the fact that some of the largest river basins have experienced a significant drying during the last century. Agreement is found on likely positive impacts of climate change on East Africa's hydropower potential, negative impacts in West and Southern Africa, and substantial uncertainty in Central Africa. Irrespective of the absolute change in gross technical potential, more frequent and intense extremes are projected. One possible paradigm to increase resilience and fulfil the pledges of the Paris Agreement is a synergetic planning and management of hydropower and variable renewables.},

On the basis of a field survey on bottom topography changes of the meandering river Allan Water at the cut-off section, a detailed study of boundary shear stresses in an idealized rigid bed model was undertaken. Both mathematical and experimental approaches were employed in the idealized model study. The analysis of results showed that continual reductions in shear stresses occurred in the bend at the side overflow region. The maximum reduction of shear stresses was 37\% in cases of low side overflows and 82\% in cases of high side overflows. These reductions were attributed to the development of stagnation and separation zones at the intersection associated with strong lateral outward currents. Based on the idealized model study, the features observed in the bed topography of Allan Water at the cutoff section are most likely to develop in cases of combined bend and high side overflows.},

It was found that for increasing Froude numbers, the main cell of secondary flow expanded and strengthened. Simultaneously, the outer-bank cell reduced in size and retreated towards the boundary. A term-by-term analysis of the energy production and the vorticity equations was performed to substantiate this observation. In the outerbank zone, for increasing Froude numbers, a reduction of the energy flux from turbulence to the mean flow was discernible; which confirms that the turbulence-induced processes affect the outerbank cell. The analysis of the vorticity equation showed the balance between generative and degenerative terms in the streamwise vorticity equation.},

  abstract = {Phase equilibrium calculations and phase stability analysis of reactive and non-reactive systems play a significant role in the simulation, design and optimization of reaction and separation processes in chemical engineering. These challenging problems, which are often multivariable and non-convex, require global optimization methods for solving them. Stochastic global optimization algorithms have shown promise in providing reliable and efficient solutions for these thermodynamic problems. In this study, we evaluate three alternative global optimization algorithms for phase and chemical equilibrium calculations, namely, Covariant Matrix Adaptation-Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) and Firefly Algorithm (FA). The performance of these three stochastic algorithms was tested and compared to identify their relative strengths for phase equilibrium and phase stability problems. The phase equilibrium problems include both multi-component systems with and without chemical reactions. FA was found to be the most reliable among the three techniques, whereas CMA-ES can find the global minimum reliably and accurately even with a smaller number of iterations.},

Four types of artificial Plexiglas structures, the first three of identical construction, had different portions painted to provide increasing habitat complexity: velocity refuge alone, velocity refuge with visual isolation, all three features combined, and overhead cover alone. Steelhead parr selected structures with overhead cover alone or all three features significantly more often than those without overhead cover. Steelhead also selected structures adjacent to the swiftest velocities available and closest to other natural overhead cover, which accounted for most differences in use of the same structure in different locations. In contrast, few age-0 coho salmon used any structures. Those that did selected the three types of structures with velocity refuge about equally, but significantly more often than those with overhead cover alone, regardless of their location. Field experiments such as this hold promise for elucidating mechanisms of habitat selection by stream salmonids.}

  abstract = {This study used 20-year records of stream channel change and wood to test hypotheses about the long-term influence of large woody debris (LWD) on channel morphology, channel stability, and sediment dynamics in a steep, boulder-rich mountain stream. We compared two nearly adjacent reaches of third-order Mack Creek over the period 1978{\textendash}1997 after virtually all wood was removed from the channel of the lower reach in 1964. We assessed the long-term legacy of wood removal using repeated cross-section surveys, streamflow data, LWD inventory data, and detailed mapping and longitudinal profile surveys. At each of 11 cross sections in the upper reach and 19 in the lower reach, we calculated areas of scour and fill in response to the two largest floods in the record. We used quasi-likelihood logistic regression models to test the proportion of each reach that experienced change between consecutive surveys over the entire record (1978{\textendash}1997) as a function of flood return periods. The longitudinal profile of the site without LWD was more variable than the reach with LWD at the finest scale ({$\sim$}1 m) due to a greater frequency of boulder steps, but the reach with LWD was more variable at the channel unit scale. LWD-created steps 1 to 2.5 m high in the wood-rich reach accounted for nearly 30\% of the total channel fall and created low-gradient upstream channel segments one to three channel widths long. As a result, both reaches have the same average slope (about 9\%), but nearly three times as much of the channel in the wood-rich reach had a slope of {$\leq$}5\% as in the reach without wood (20.4\% of total channel length vs. 7.5\% of channel length). The reach with abundant LWD was less responsive to moderate streamflow events (return period {$<\sim$}5 years), but it responded similarly to peak flows with a return period of about 10 to 25 years. Although the average magnitude of cross-section changes was the same during the largest flood in the record (25-year return period), the reach without LWD experienced scour and coarsening of the bed surface, whereas the reach with LWD experienced aggradation upstream of LWD features. Mack Creek may be representative of many steep mountain streams in which channel structure is strongly influenced by nonfluvial processes: a legacy of large boulders from glacial or mass movement processes and a legacy of dead wood from ecological processes. Sediment-limited mountain streams with large boulders, when deprived of LWD, appear to exhibit less morphological variation at the channel unit scale, to store less sediment, and to release it more readily than those with LWD.},

For hydropower reservoirs, one option is to increase the transport of fine sediments through power waterways and hence the turbines. This has ecological advantages because the suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in downstream river reaches are similar to pre-dam conditions. However, the operation costs increase due to (i) additional efforts for sediment handling (measures to reduce settling and/or re-suspend sediment) and (ii) hydro-abrasive erosion on turbines. It is proposed to determine the acceptable SSC by balancing these costs against the value of the maintained or restored reservoir volume. Although technical solutions for sediment handling and turbine erosion mitigation are available, further research including comprehensive field tests is recommended.},

Previous studies have proposed a large number of empirical and semiempirical methods to estimate the critical erosion and deposition shear stress, but comparative analyses and validation of the existing methods are still lacking, leaving questions regarding the applicability ranges of the methods. The current paper evaluates the performance and applicability range of five critical erosion shear stress methods derived from different hypotheses on sediment transport for flume experiments and natural tidal rivers using a process-based model. In addition, the effect of the critical deposition shear stress on sediment transport is investigated. The results show that the different critical erosion shear stress methods yield distinctly different prediction results, and their performance and applicability ranges are discussed by comparing their predictions with measured sediment concentrations from the Shenzhen River and measured geometric changes from the Partheniades' flume experiment. The hiding and exposure effect has been recognized as a crucial factor in the incipient motion of sediment on nonuniform beds. A sensitivity analysis of selective deposition and continuous deposition justifies the existence of the critical deposition shear stress. The current study highlights the performance and applicability ranges of the existing critical shear stress methods in sediment transport modeling for uniform and nonuniform beds, which will enrich understanding of the underlying mechanisms of erosion and deposition of cohesive sediment.},

A partial unification is suggested for some previous semiempirical models and physical concepts. Two new equations are proposed: a nondimensional hydraulic geometry equation with different parameters for deep and shallow flows, and a variable-power resistance equation that is asymptotic to roughness-layer formulations for shallow flows and to the Manning-Strickler approximation of the logarithmic friction law for deep flows. Predictions by existing and new equations using D84 as roughness scale are compared to a compilation of measured velocities in natural streams at relative submergences from 0.1 to over 30. The variable-power equation performs as well as the best existing approach, which is a logarithmic law with roughness multiplier. For predicting how a known or assumed discharge is partitioned between depth and velocity, a nondimensional hydraulic geometry approach outperforms equations using relative submergence. Factor-of-two prediction errors occur with all approaches because of sensitivity to operational definitions of depth, velocity, and slope, the inadequacy of using a single grain-size length scale, and the complexity of flow physics in steep shallow streams.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive methodology that integrates erosion models, Geographic Information System (GIs) techniques, and a sediment delivery concept for estimating water erosion and sediment delivery at the watershed scale was presented. The method was applied to a typical agricultural watershed in the state of Idaho, which is subject to increasing soil erosion and flooding problems. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was used to assess mean annual water erosion. The Sediment Delivery Distributed (SEDD) model was adapted to determine sediment transport to perennial streams. The spatial pattern of annual soil erosion and sediment yield was obtained by integrating RUSLE, SEDD, and a raster GIS (Arcview). Required GIS data layers included precipitation, soil characteristics, elevation, and land use. Current cropping and management practices and selected, feasible, future management practices were evaluated to determine their effects on average annual soil loss. Substantial reduction in water erosion can be achieved when future conservation support practices are applied. The integrated approach allows for relatively easy, fast, and cost-effective estimation of spatially distributed soil erosion and sediment delivery. It thus provides a useful and efficient tool for predicting long-term water erosion potential and assessing erosion impacts of various cropping systems and conservation support practices.},

Depending on the relative location of the inlet and outlet with respect to the reservoir centreline, contrasting flow patterns are obtained, involving either no flow reattachment, or a jet reattached on either of the reservoir sidewalls. The results reveal also the occurrence of bi-stable flow configurations, i.e. different steady state flow fields are reached depending on the flow history. This is of high relevance for the design of shallow reservoirs as such configurations should certainly be avoided to achieve a robust hydraulic sizing of the reservoir.},

An outline of the present understanding of the kinematics of meandering flow and how the flow shapes the bed, with a view towards the conditions in real alluvial meandering rivers, is presented. The flow and its interaction with the bed are analyzed by treating separately the effects on the flow of channel curvature and streamwise variation of channel curvature and by considering the results of numerous laboratory and numerical experiments carried out to date. The approach is used to explain essential differences in meandering bed topography exhibited by streams with varying values of sinuosity and width-to-depth ratio. The paper is also used as an opportunity to address the question of why, in the absence of geological constraints, some streams tend to remain regular in plan shape (i.e., symmetric in plan view with regard to the axis of bend) even when their loops actively expand laterally, whereas others acquire irregular plan shapes. This question is considered in view of the intrinsically different mechanics of bed deformation and bank erosion and a new experiment on bank erosion. The paper suggests that differences in the erodibility of the bed and banks may be a significant contributing factor to the planimetric fate of the stream.

  abstract = {Because eroded sediments are produced from different sources throughout a basin, it is often advantageous to model sediment delivery processes at basin scale using a spatially distributed approach. In this paper, a sediment delivery distributed (SEDD) model applicable at morphological unit scale, into which a basin is divided, is initially proposed. The model is based on the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), in which different expressions of the erosivity and topographic factors are considered, coupled with a relationship for evaluating the sediment delivery ratio of each morphological unit. Then the SEDD model is calibrated by sediment yield and rainfall and runoff measurements carried out, at annual and event scales, in three small Calabrian experimental basis. At event scale, the analysis showed that a good agreement between measured and calculated basin sediment yields can be obtained using the simple rainfall erosivity factor; the agreement is independent of the selected equations for estimating the topographic factors. The analysis developed at annual scale showed that the model reliability increases from the event scale to the annual scale. Finally, a Monte Carlo technique was used for evaluating the effects of the uncertainty of the model parameters on calculated sediment yield.},

The channel had two bends, a trapezoidal cross section, and a slope of S {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0:005. Gravel with a mean diameter of 4.2 mm was used as movable bed material and for sediment feeding. Wu's formula for multiple grain sizes was compared with van Rijn's formula using one grain size. Fairly good agreement was found between the computed and measured bed elevations for both approaches, whereas Wu's formula could further improve the numerical results. Looking at the physics of the erosion pattern, the computed scour areas were located slightly more downstream than what was observed in the physical model. The current study also includes several parameter tests: grid distribution in vertical, lateral, and longitudinal direction; time step; number of inner iterations/time step; active sediment layer thickness; and the Shields coefficient. The variation of those parameters gave some differences in the results, but the overall pattern of bed elevation changes remained the same.

  abstract = {Despite uncertainty in all levels of analysis, recent and long-term changes in our climate point to the distinct possibility that greenhouse gas emissions have altered mean annual temperatures, precipitation and weather patterns. Modeling efforts that use doubled atmospheric CO2 scenarios predict a 1{\textendash}7{\textdegree}C mean global temperature increase, regional changes in precipitation patterns and storm tracks, and the possibility of ``surprises'' or sudden irreversible regime shifts. The general effects of climate change on freshwater systems will likely be increased water temperatures, decreased dissolved oxygen levels, and the increased toxicity of pollutants. In lotic systems, altered hydrologic regimes and increased groundwater temperatures could affect the quality of fish habitat. In lentic systems, eutrophication may be exacerbated or offset, and stratification will likely become more pronounced and stronger. This could alter food webs and change habitat availability and quality. Fish physiology is inextricably linked to temperature, and fish have evolved to cope with specific hydrologic regimes and habitat niches. Therefore, their physiology and life histories will be affected by alterations induced by climate change. Fish communities may change as range shifts will likely occur on a species level, not a community level; this will add novel biotic pressures to aquatic communities. Genetic change is also possible and is the only biological option for fish that are unable to migrate or acclimate. Endemic species, species in fragmented habitats, or those in east{\textendash}west oriented systems will be less able to follow changing thermal isolines over time. Artisanal, commercial, and recreational fisheries worldwide depend upon freshwater fishes. Impacted fisheries may make it difficult for developing countries to meet their food demand, and developed countries may experience economic losses. As it strengthens over time, global climate change will become a more powerful stressor for fish living in natural or artificial systems. Furthermore, human response to climate change (e.g., increased water diversion) will exacerbate its already-detrimental effects.},

The new method combines the advantages of truncated singular value decomposition with those of the classical Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt algorithm, thus enabling a more robust solution of underdetermined inverse problems with complex relations between the parameters to be estimated and the observable state variables used for calibration. The truncation limit separating the solution space from the calibration null space is re-evaluated during the iterative calibration process. In between these re-evaluations, fewer forward simulations are required, compared to the standard approach, to calculate the approximate sensitivity matrix. Truncated singular values are used to calculate the Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt parameter updates, ensuring that safe small steps along the steepest-descent direction are taken for highly correlated parameters of low sensitivity, whereas efficient quasi-Gauss{\textendash}Newton steps are taken for independent parameters with high impact. The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated for a synthetic data set representing infiltration into a partially saturated, heterogeneous soil, where hydrogeological, petrophysical, and geostatistical parameters are estimated based on the joint inversion of hydrological and geophysical data.},

The experiments provided data for bed deformation and grain sorting processes in a 180◦ channel bend. The data were used to investigate the performance of different sediment transport approaches. The original van Rijn formula for uniform sediments was compared with two advanced nonuniform sediment formulas that considered the interaction between individual grain sizes by defining hiding-exposure approaches. The results showed that the default configuration of the model was able to predict bed deformations and grain sorting processes with satisfying magnitude and trend. However, the default approach considerably overestimated the bar evolution. The computed results improved significantly when applying any of the introduced hidingexposure approaches, representing better the physical mechanisms of the hiding-exposure effect. This study shows that the present numerical model is able to predict the morphodynamic bed changes in a flume of nonuniform sediments with good agreement if appropriate sediment formulations are used.},

Subsystems include the central surface stream, vertically and laterally arrayed saturated sediments (hyporheic and parafluvial zones), and the most distal element, the riparian zone. These zones are hydrologically connected; thus water and its dissolved and suspended load move through all of these subsystems as it flows downstream. In any given subsystem, chemical transformations result in a change in the quantity of materials in transport. Processing length is the length of subsystem required to "process" an amount of substrate equal to advective input. Long processing lengths reflect low rates of material cycling. Processing length provides the length dimension of each cylindrical element of the telescope and is specific to subsystem (for example, the surface stream), substrate (for instance, nitrate), and process (denitrification, for example). Disturbance causes processing length to increase. Processing length decreases during succession following disturbance. The whole stream-corridor ecosystem consists of several nested cylindrical elements that extend and retract, much as would a telescope, in response to disturbance regime. This telescoping ecosystem model (TEM) can improve understanding of material retention in running water systems; that is, their "nutrient filtration" capacity. We hypothesize that disturbance by flooding alters this capacity in proportion to both intensity of disturbance and to the relative effect of disturbance on each subsystem. We would expect more distal subsystems (for example, the riparian zone) to show the highest resistance to floods. fn contrast, we predict that postflood recovery of functions such as material processing (that is, resilience) will be highest in central elements and decrease laterally. Resistance and resilience of subsystems are thus both inversely correlated and spatially separated. We further hypothesize that cross-linkages between adjacent subsystems will enhance resilience of the system as a whole. Whole-ecosystem retention transformation, and transport are thus viewed as a function of subsystem extent, lateral and vertical linkage, and disturbance regime.}

This can lead to a burden in wastewater sludge; on the other hand, the sorption properties can be used for water purification.

EPS retain water and prevent desiccation. Cohesion and adhesion are provided by a network of fluctuating adhesion points. External pressure can change the structure from a gel to a highly viscous liquid. Due to their sorptive properties, dissolved nutrients from the water phase are accumulated and increase the survival chances of biofilm organisms in oligotrophic environments. The matrix facilitates gene exchange and regulation processes via signalling molecules. It provides a template for extracellular enzymes and prevents that they are washed out. Thus, it is of great importance for the degradation of solids and particles. Remnants of lysed cells are retained and can be utilized as food source. Thus, biofilms can be considered as a natural example for sustainable use of nutrients. Some EPS are biotechnologically employed as additives for food, drilling fluids and as biosurfactants.},

Although shade and hyporheic exchange may have similar effects on stream temperatures, their mechanisms differ. Improved understanding of the heat-exchange mechanisms influenced by shade and hyporheic exchange will aid in the appropriate application of either stream temperature management strategy. To illustrate a conceptual model highlighting shade as `thermal insulation' and hyporheic exchange imparting `thermal capacitance' to a stream reach, we conducted an in-silico simulation modelling experiment increasing shade or hyporheic exchange parameters on an idealized, hypothetical stream. We assessed the potential effects of increasing shade or hyporheic exchange on a stream reach using an established process-based heat-energy budget model of stream-atmosphere heat exchange and incorporated an advection-driven hyporheic heat exchange routine. The model tracked heat transport through the hyporheic zone and exchange with the stream channel, while including the effects of hyporheic water age distribution on upwelling hyporheic temperatures. Results showed that shade and hyporheic exchange similarly damped diurnal temperature cycles and differentially altered seasonal cycles of our theoretical stream. In winter, hyporheic exchange warmed simulated channel temperatures whereas shade had little effect. In summer, both shade and hyporheic exchange cooled channel temperatures, though the effects of shade were more pronounced. Our simple-to-grasp analogies of `thermal insulation' for shade effects and `thermal capacitance' for hyporheic exchange effects on stream temperature encourage more accurate conceptualization of complex, dynamic heat exchange processes among the atmosphere, stream channel, and alluvial aquifer.},

Information provided by eyewitnesses via social media is a valuable information source, which should be explored in a{\textasciitilde}more effective way. This research proposes a methodology that leverages social media content to support rapid inundation mapping, including inundation extent and water depth in the case of floods. The novelty of this approach is the utilization of quantitative data that are derived from photos from eyewitnesses extracted from social media posts and their integration with established data. Due to the rapid availability of these posts compared to traditional data sources such as remote sensing data, areas affected by a flood, for example, can be determined quickly. The challenge is to filter the large number of posts to a manageable amount of potentially useful inundation-related information, as well as to interpret and integrate the posts into mapping procedures in a timely manner. To support rapid inundation mapping we propose a methodology and develop "PostDistiller", a tool to filter geolocated posts from social media services which include links to photos. This spatial distributed contextualized in situ information is further explored manually. In an application case study during the June 2013 flood in central Europe we evaluate the utilization of this approach to infer spatial flood patterns and inundation depths in the city of Dresden.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Channel-spanning wood jams create an upstream backwater, increasing flow heterogeneity, sediment deposition, and ecological productivity, but also flood risk. Backwater rise prediction is necessary to evaluate flood hazards in hydraulic models, improve design of engineered logjam projects, and compare jam effects across river systems. We present experimental results demonstrating that a jam can be modeled as a porous obstruction generating momentum loss proportional to the number, size, and packing density of the logs and the jam length. Energy and momentumconstraints are combined to predict backwater rise from unit discharge and a dimensionless structural parameter. This novel approach allows description of preexisting jams with a common metric. The model was used to demonstrate how backwater length, pool size, and upstream sediment deposition depend on jam structure and channel slope.},

To supplement and constrain the modelling experiments with on-site observations, a network of terrestrial time-lapse cameras was set up in one of these catchments. The spatiotemporal patterns of snow depth inside the forest and at the adjacent open field sites were recorded along with snow interception dynamics. Comparison of observed and modelled snow cover and canopy interception indicates that the new version of WaSiM reliably reconstructs the variability of snow accumulation for both the forest and the open field.

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive methodology for realistically animating liquid phenomena. Our approach unifies existing computer graphics techniques for simulating fluids and extends them by incorporating more complex behavior. It is based on the Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations which couple momentum and mass conservation to completely describe fluid motion. Our starting point is an environment containing an arbitrary distribution of fluid, and submerged or semisubmerged obstacles. Velocity and pressure are defined everywhere within this environment and updated using a set of finite difference expressions. The resulting vector and scalar fields are used to drive a height field equation representing the liquid surface. The nature of the coupling between obstacles in the environment and free variables allows for the simulation of a wide range of effects that were not possible with previous computer graphics fluid models. Wave effects such as reflection, refraction, and diffraction, as well as rotational effects such as eddies, vorticity, and splashing are a natural consequence of solving the system. In addition, the Lagrange equations of motion are used to place buoyant dynamic objects into a scene and track the position of spray and foam during the animation process. Typical disadvantages to dynamic simulations such as poor scalability and lack of control are addressed by assuming that stationary obstacles align with grid cells during the finite difference discretization, and by appending terms to the Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations to include forcing functions. Free surfaces in our system are represented as either a collection of massless particles in 2D, or a height field which is suitable for many of the water rendering algorithms presented by researchers in recent years.}

  abstract = {Reservoir sedimentation is the gradual accumulation of incoming sediments from upstream catchment leading to the reduction in useful storage capacity of the reservoir. Quantifying the reservoir sedimentation rate is essential for better water resources management. Conventional techniques such as hydrographic survey have limitations including timeconsuming, cumbersome and costly. On the contrary, the availability of high resolution (both spatial and temporal) in public domain overcomes all these constraints. This study assessed Jayakwadi reservoir sedimentation using Landsat 8 OLI satellite data combined with ancillary data. Multi-date remotely sensed data were used to produce the water spread area of the reservoir, which was applied to compute the sedimentation rate. The revised live storage capacity of the reservoir between maximum and minimum levels observed under the period of analysis (2015{\textendash}2017) was assessed utilizing the trapezoidal formula. The revised live storage capacity is assessed as 1942.258 against the designed capacity of 2170.935 Mm3 at full reservoir level. The total loss of reservoir capacity due to the sediment deposition during the period of 41 years (1975{\textendash}2017) was estimated as 228.677 Mm3 (10.53\%) which provided the average sedimentation rate of 5.58 Mm3 year1. As this technique also provides the capacity of the reservoir at the different elevation on the date of the satellite pass, the revised elevation{\textendash}capacity curve was also developed. The sedimentation analysis usually provides the volume of sediment deposited and rate of the deposition. However, the interest of the reservoir authorities and water resources planner's lies in sub-watershed-wise sediment yield, and the critical sub-watersheds upstream reservoir requires conservation, etc. Therefore, in the present study, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used for the estimation of sediment yield of the reservoir. The average annual sediment yield obtained from the SWAT model using 36 years of data (1979{\textendash}2014) was 13.144 Mm3 year-1 with the density of the soil (loamy and clay) of 1.44 ton m-3. The findings revealed that the rate of sedimentation obtained from the remote sensing-based methods is in agreement with the results of the hydrographic survey.},

Turbulent flows are common in nature and have an important role in geophysical disciplines such as river morphology, landscape modeling, atmospheric dynamics and ocean currents. At present, new measurement and observation techniques suitable for fieldwork can be combined with laboratory and theoretical work to advance the understanding of river processes. Nevertheless, despite more than a century of attempts to correctly formalize turbulent flows, much still remains to be done by researchers and engineers working in hydraulics and fluid mechanics. In this contribution we introduce a general framework for the analysis of river turbulence. We revisit some findings and theoretical frameworks and provide a critical analysis of where the study of turbulence is important and how to include detailed information of this in the analysis of fluvial processes. We also provide a perspective of some general aspects that are essential for researchers/practitioners addressing the subject for the first time. Furthermore, we show some results of interest to scientists and engineers working on river flows.},

  abstract = {Hydrological distributed models demand large amounts of data, information and parameters in order to accurately represent the spatial variability of the main hydrological processes and inputs. The parameter estimation is always a complex and expensive task which is often unaffordable and therefore hydrologists are frequently forced to disregard distributed modelling in favour of lumped or semidistributed models. To solve this situation, we propose in this paper to split the effective parameter at each cell in two components: the hydrological characteristic (at point scale and maintaining its physical meaning) and a correction factor (common for all cells and taking into account all modelling errors including the temporal and spatial scale effects). The new split-parameter structure adopted in our distributed model (called TETIS) is coupled with the SCE-UA automatic optimization method in order to obtain the set of optimal correction factors of the model, without loosing the spatial variability described by the a priori estimated hydrological characteristics. Automatic procedures can be easily adapted to the split-parameter structure because the number of variables to be calibrated is dramatically reduced from thousands of cell parameters to a small number of common correction factors (one for each parameter map). Also, the optimum initial values of the state variables can be obtained automatically. In order to show the advantages of the new structure a real application is performed in a case study in which the calibration and the spatial and spatial{\textendash}temporal validation processes have been carried out. The results can be considered as being excellent and it is concluded that automatic calibration with the SCE-UA algorithm has been shown to be reliable and fast.},

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the ability of the resulting algorithm, GA-SQP, to find the optimal parameter values during calibration of a conceptual rainfallrunoff (CRR) model. Two types of analysis were performed. The first refers to a theoretical case free of model and data errors, while the second refers to a real case in which the rainfall and runoff data were affected by evaluation errors. Specifically, in the synthetic data study, where the real set of parameters was known a priori, a 100\% success rate was observed, and in all cases the number of objective function evaluations remained relatively limited.},

The analyses were conducted using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model applied both to a single basin and to a complex basin. For both types of basin, a theoretical case without model and data errors was considered, in which the true values of the parameters are known a priori, and several real-world cases where model and data errors exist. With reference to the single basin, the SCE-UA algorithm was the most reliable while the other two algorithms gave solutions equivalent to those of the SCE-UA in the theoretical case, but in the realworld cases they showed an increasing tendency (particularly the PS-SQP) to be trapped in local minima. With reference to the complex basin, none of the three algorithms identified the exact solution in the theoretical case. However, the SCEUA was the one which systematically approximated it better than the others. In the real-world case its solutions were stable but characterized by many parameter values set at the boundary of their own range. The other two algorithms produced a very unstable set of parameters.},

  abstract = {Current `physically based' soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) schemes use increasingly complex descriptions of the physical mechanisms governing evapotranspiration fluxes, thereby requiring the specification of a large number of parameters controlling the vertical fluxes over a single homogeneous area. Recent attention towards the incorporation of sub-grid scale spatial variability in SVAT parameterisations promises to increase the number of parameters for these models. In this paper, it is demonstrated that a simple patch scale SVAT model still permits too many degrees of freedom in terms of fitting the model predictions to calibration or validation data; it is shown that good model fits may be achieved in many areas of the parameter space. Using a Monte Carlo framework, a sensitivity analysis is performed for simulations of data sets from FIFE and Amazonian sites. This is employed to evaluate the role of each parameter for each forcing dataset, and to identify the controlling and redundant parameters and processes. The results suggest that equifinality of parameter sets in calibration to field data must be expected, that there will be a consequent uncertainty in predictive capability and that more emphasis will be required on identifying the critical controls on evapotranspiration in extending predictions from patch to landscape scale in different environments.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic activities often increase the flux of fine sediment to fluvial environments. In gravel-bed streams the extent to which augmented fines loading causes the degradation of vital interstitial habitats is determined by factors controlling fines infiltration into channel substratum. Previous research suggests that substrate pore constriction size, intensity of upwelling interstitial flow, and the quantity of fines transported across the bed surface (i.e., exposure dose) are three important factors controlling substrate fines content. Few field studies have investigated the interactive effects of these physical factors. We constructed 17 experimental redds in brook trout spawning microhabitats in a boreal forest stream in Quebec, Canada, to investigate the role of pore constriction size, hyporheic flow, and exposure dose on substrate fines content. To simulate the effect of spawning in coarsening the substrates, redds were partially cleaned of coarse sand and of all fine sediment ({$<$}0.5mm). Results show that coarse sands and fine gravel (0.5{\textendash}4mm; filter class) acted as a filter of percolating fine sediment ({$<$}0.5mm). We found that this filtering effect (i.e., lower fines density at egg pocket depth) occurred at sites where the proportion of the filter class in the substratum above egg pocket depth exceeded a threshold value of 18\%, as indicated by a statistically significant step-function response between fines gradient with depth and the filter class content in the uppermost layers of the bed. Results also indicated that fines content at depth was unrelated to fines exposure. Estimated upward seepage rates were well below the threshold velocity that would inhibit the percolation of medium-grained sand (i.e., 0.5mm) into the bed. These results suggest that within these gravel-bed spawning substrates the abundance of filter classes was the primary determinant of fines content at depth. This study highlights the importance of considering filter class content in the implementation of spawning habitat rehabilitation schemes and when assessing the susceptibility of incubation microhabitats to augmented fine sediment loading to streams.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.},

Yet grain{\textendash}grain interactions are important and bedload should also be considered as a granular phenomenon. We review progress made recently in the study of granular flows, especially on segregation and rheology, that better illuminates the nature of bedload. Granular flows may exhibit gas-like or fluid-like flow, or quasi-solid deformation. All three conditions might be duplicated in bedload. Understanding of intense bedload transport occurring continuously in a layer several grains deep {\textendash} typical of sand beds {\textendash} might greatly benefit from results in granular physics, as illustrated by grain-inspired bedload results. However, processes restricted to the surface of the bed, when particles move intermittently and the bed becomes structured, while characteristic in gravel-bed channels, are not well addressed in granular physics. Mutual study of these phenomena may benefit both physics and fluvial geomorphology. We intend, therefore, to contribute to an enhanced dialogue between granular physics and bedload science communities.},

The large data sets enable a range of analytical approaches that single out important patterns in highly variable data.: importance of humic substances in reducing the negative impact of low pH; impact of very low levels of BOD ({$<$}2 mg L-1); higher sensitivity of trait-based metrics compared with identity-based metrics and importance of catchment and riparian vegetation for the ecological quality of streams. 3. We advocate an increased use of monitoring and survey data in addressing questions relevant to scientist and end-users, but issues relating to especially data quality should be considered.

The main drivers of environmental change relate primarily to agriculture, urbanization, and industrial production that have resulted in severe habitat degradation in streams and rivers worldwide. The increasing impact of climate change and invasive species has put further pressure on these systems. For more than a century, status of rivers and streams has been assessed using biological indicators and represents a prime example of applying ecological knowledge to address societal issues. Today, legislative regulations and water management rely primarily on measurements of ecological status through the assessment of biotic communities. There has been a continuous development of these biological indicators but primarily based on fundamental approaches that date back to the original assessment systems. The indicators used today ignore large parts of what is occurring in the ecosystem and cannot, in most cases, diagnose the cause of degradation with a reasonable precision. There is clearly a need to improve existing assessment systems through new and innovative approaches that, as an example, include ecosystem processes and can be linked more closely to the services that lotic ecosystems provide. This article critically reviews the use of biological indicators in the context of inherent properties of lotic ecosystems and types of degradation, and suggests how assessment could be refined through applying a number of additional approaches to those already used.

A large part of this paper is based on the outcomes of the REFORM (REstoring rivers FOR effective catchment Management, http://reformrivers.eu/) project that was funded by EU's 7th Framework Programme (2011{\textendash}15). REFORM included the most comprehensive comparison, to date, of existing river restorations across Europe and their effect on biota, both in relation to preintervention state and project size in terms of river length restored. The REFORM project outcomes are supplemented by an extensive literature review and two case studies to illustrate key points. We conclude that river restorations conducted up until now have had highly variable effects with, on balance, more positives than negatives. The largest positive effects have interestingly been in terrestrial and semiaquatic organism groups, in widening projects, while positive effects on truly aquatic organisms groups are only seen when in-stream measures are applied. The positive responses of biota are primarily seen as increased abundance of organisms with very little indication that overall biodiversity has increased: specific traits rather than mere species number or total abundance have benefited from restoration interventions. This modest success rate can partly be attributed to the fact that the catchment filter is largely ignored; large-scale pressures related to catchment land use or the lack of source populations for the recolonisation of the restored habitats are inadequately considered. The key reason for this shortfall is a lack of clear objective setting and planning processes. Furthermore, we suggest that there has been a focus on form rather than processes and functioning in river restoration, which has truncated the evolution of geomorphic features and any dynamic interaction with biota. Finally, monitoring of restoration outcomes is still rare and often uses inadequate statistical designs and inappropriate biological methods which hamper our ability to detect change.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, many rivers are affected by various river engineering measures and exhibit ecological deficits as a result. Sediment input from upstream is often limited by the presence of hydropower plants, sediment retention basins, and other river training measures, resulting in a lack of bed-load and morphological degradation. Sediment deficit can undermine structures, negatively influence groundwater formation, and decrease habitat quality for aquatic flora and fauna. Sediment replenishment by means of artificial gravel deposits or enhanced by bank erosion are two options when attempting to compensate for sediment deficits in rivers and to improve their ecological conditions. The ability to predict bank erosion rates and their impact on the river reach are important when attempting to implement restoration projects successfully.  In the first part of this study, experiments are conducted on the erosion pattern of artificial gravel deposits to (i) investigate the influence of the governing parameters on the erosion process of gravel deposits, (ii) improve understanding of fluvial bank erosion in case of non-cohesive, granular bank material, and (iii) identify the fundamentals  to implement and improve bank erosion in numerical models. In a second test series, the ability of non-submerged structures to enhance bank erosion is evaluated. Erodible and non-erodible structures are tested to obtain bank erosion volumes that are favourable from river engineering and ecological perspectives. In a third test series, the long-term evolution of the bed of a typical Swiss river as a result of changing sediment supply is investigated. Predicting equations intended to describe the erosion pattern of artificial gravel deposits and to estimate the backwater rise that occurs due to gravel deposits are proposed. This study demonstrates that an excess shear stress relation can describe the temporal evolution of the mean erosion rate of an artificial gravel deposit.  Non-erodible structures perpendicular to a river's bank and groins on the opposite bank are efficient to enhance bank erosion for discharges where no or negligible bank erosion occurs without a structure being present. The introduction of large wood debris jams is a promising option for enhancing bank erosion, as this approach combines low maintenance requirements with the immediate creation of complex habitats. In the third test series, channel responses to a long-term change in sediment supply took the form of a combination of (i) an adjustment on the grain scale by a smoothening of the bed; (ii) a change of the cross-sectional shape by sediment deposition, primarily in the thalweg; and (iii) and a reduction of the longitudinal bed slope.  This study's findings allow for improved predictions of the rate and magnitude of bank erosion and their subsequent impact on the downstream river reach; thus, they can consequently aid in determining design frequency and deposit volumes for planned restoration projects.},

At issue is how error in the estimates of theseprobabilities affects classification error when the estimates are used ina classification rule. These effects are seen to be somewhat counterintuitive in both their strength and nature. In particular the bias andvariance components of the estimation error combine to influenceclassification in a very different way than with squared error on theprobabilities themselves. Certain types of (very high) bias can becanceled by low variance to produce accurate classification. This candramatically mitigate the effect of the bias associated with some simpleestimators like ``naive'' Bayes, and the bias induced by thecurse-of-dimensionality on nearest-neighbor procedures. This helps explainwhy such simple methods are often competitive with and sometimes superiorto more sophisticated ones for classification, and why``bagging/aggregating'' classifiers can often improveaccuracy. These results also suggest simple modifications to theseprocedures that can (sometimes dramatically) further improve theirclassification performance.},

We have gained a better understanding of the hazards posed by the recruitment and transport of LW in the river channel and associated infrastructure. While LW dynamics have traditionally been studied in the natural river environment, innovations in laboratory techniques have enabled important advances in understanding LW process dynamics, using physical scale models, new sensors, scanners and sophisticated model boundary conditions. Current trends in LW laboratory research focus on (1) mobilization and transport of logs, (2) trapping and deposition of sediment in the presence of LW and (3) LW contribution to hydraulic flow resistance. Ultimately, a combined process understanding is needed to assess impacts upon infrastructure with erodible boundaries, such as bridge piers and LW retention racks. In this review, we present a critical analysis of emerging experimental work on LW obtained through physical modelling studies. We put recent experimental work in context with global LW management challenges. In particular, we set our work in context with the present environmental and engineering issues that confront catchment and natural resource managers in Switzerland and New Zealand. We show how improved physical models incorporating LW transport, accumulation and scouring processes are needed to contribute to more reliable hazard and risk assessment and improved river management in LW-prone systems.},

The cohesive strength meter Mk III was used to determine critical erosion shear stress (,cc) within a variety of different intertidal habitats and substrata, including Spartina maritima fields and Zostera noltii beds. The best predictor(s) for tau(c) were derived from a range of properties measured for the surface sediments (chlorophyll a, colloidal carbohydrate, water, organic content, \% fraction {$<$} 63 mum, and seabed elevation). Pigment biomarkers were used to identify the dominant algal groups within the surface phytobenthic assemblage. Strong, seasonally dependent relationships were found between tau(c) and habitat type, chl a, colloidal carbohydrate and bed elevation. Typically, critical erosion thresholds decreased seawards, reflecting a change from biostabilisation by cyanobacteria in the upper intertidal areas, to biostabilisation by diatoms on the bare substrata of the channel edges. In the late summer/early autumn, cyanobacteria were the main sediment stabilisers, and colloidal carbohydrate was the best bio-dependent predictor of tau(c) across the entire field area. In the late winter/early spring, cyanobacterial activity was lower, and sediment stabilisation by Enteromorpha clathrata was important; the best predictor of tau(c) was bed elevation. The implications and use of proxies for sediment stability are discussed in terms of feedback and sedimentation processes operating across the intertidal area. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The majority of investigations that have measured sediment properties related to intertidal sediment stability have been undertaken during daylight subaerial exposure periods. As a consequence, models based upon such data represent only partially the intertidal flat surface conditions within any 24 h period. In this contribution, a comparison is made between surface sediment properties related to sediment stability measured during six consecutive (day/night), semi-diurnal subaerial exposure periods, at three stations on an intertidal sand flat in late March 1999. The study site was selected on the basis of its suitability for sampling and data collection at night, with special regard to safety and logistics. Seawater temperatures ranged from 4.1 to 9.6 degreesC, and salinities from 33.9 to 34.8. Eleven parameters related to intertidal flat sediment stability were measured, or derived. These variables included the critical erosion shear stress (tau(c)), chlorophyll a, phaeopigment, and colloidal carbohydrate content, mean grain size and settling velocity of the surface (0-1 mm) sediment fraction. Bed elevation was described using an acretion/erosion parameter (AEP) (West and West, 1991), whilst additional physical terms included ambient seawater salinity and temperature, as well as tidal range and wind speed, during the preceding immersion periods. One-way ANOVA was used to detect significant differences between day- and night-time emersion periods; similarly, principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to detect continuous variation between properties. The results show a high degree of temporal and spatial variability between day- and night-time intertidal flat variables, the PCA differentiating clearly between day and night conditions. Surface sediments across the intertidal flat exhibited varying degrees of biostabilisation. The maximum biostabilisation coefficient (18) was recorded at night in high microalgal biomass areas; the minimum (5) occurred during both day and night, in areas with lower microalgal biomass. All surface sediment parameters varied rhythmically between day- and night-time. Significant differences were found between day- and night-time biostabilisation coefficients, however, differences between day- and night-time tau(c) values were not detected. It is suggested that sediment stability at night is enhanced in high microalgal biomass areas as a result of degradation products from bound extra-cellular polysaccharides (EPS) not easily detected using standard extraction procedures.

Significant differences between day- and night-time critical erosion shear stress (tau(c)) and chlorophyll a were found. A high degree of temporal and spatial variability existed between the sediment properties. During the first half of the study period, a rhythmic day-night variation occurred between tau(c), chl a, colloidal-S- and EDTA-extracted carbohydrate. During the second part of the study, the magnitude of variation of these parameters diminished. Results showed that sediments were more stable during the day than at night. Differences between day- and night-time sediment stability were related not only to diatom migration, but also to wave energy during preceding immersion periods. No significant relationships existed between tau(c) and either chl a, or colloidal-S- or EDTA-extracted carbohydrate sediment content. It is suggested that tidal phasing, in terms of both the time during the day at which low water spring and neap tides occur, as well as the duration of the emersion period, control the biomass dynamics. The tidal phasing effect is expected to be more pronounced on a cohesive intertidal flat where low water spring tides occur at noon and midnight. The results of this study will be of use in time-dependent estuarine models. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {Predictions of the deposition rate of fine particles are integral to the study of the transport of many constituents, including contaminants and organic matter. Generally, fine-particle deposition rates are assumed to be equivalent to the suspension settling velocity. Deposition rates in excess of settling are considered enhanced. Flume observations of deposition were made using treatments that covered a wide range of flow, particle, and bed conditions. No enhancement was observed to impermeable boundaries. Specific treatments of sand bed experiments demonstrated large enhancements (up to eight times settling). For coarser sediment beds, little to no enhancement was observed. Previously identified mechanisms that could alter deposition rates, such as topography and aggregation, were dismissed using careful flow and particle size distribution measurements. Correlations between drag coefficient and deposition suggest that the mechanisms delivering additional particles to the sediment also reduce the effective drag of the bed on the flow. This is consistent with velocity slip at the sediment-water interface. Another trend evident in the data is a dependence on the ratio of the bed grain size to particle diameter. Small ratios were associated with large enhancements, consistent with the idea that filtration within the sediment could be retaining delivered particles. In concert, fluid incursions and bed filtration might be capable of increasing the particle flux to the bed. The observation of enhanced deposition to flat sediment beds reinforces the importance of permeable sediments to the transport of particles from the water column to the sediment bed.},

  abstract = {River bifurcations strongly control the distribution of water and sediment over a river system. A good understanding of this distribution process is crucial for river management. In this paper, an extensive data set from three large bifurcations in the Dutch Rhine is presented, containing data on bed-load transport, suspended bed sediment transport, dune development and hydrodynamics. The data show complex variations in sediment transport during discharge waves. The objective of this paper is to examine and explain these measured variations in sediment transport. It is found that bend sorting upstream of the bifurcations leads to supply limitation, particularly in the downstream branch that originates in the outer bend of the main channel. Tidal water level variations lead to cyclical variations in the sediment distribution over the downstream branches. Lags in dune development cause complex hysteresis patterns in flow parameters and sediment transport. All bifurcations show evidence of sediment waves, which probably are intrinsic bifurcation phenomena. The complex transport processes at the three bifurcations cause distinct discontinuities in the downstream fining trend of the river. Differences among the studied river bifurcations are mainly due to differences in sediment mobility (Shields value). Because the variations in sediment transport are complex and poorly correlated with the flow discharge, prediction of the sediment distribution with existing relationships for one-dimensional models is problematic.},

  abstract = {Although porosity is a key property of sediment mixtures, little is known of the natural variations in porosity in fluvial systems. Porosity predictors can help to generate such information. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of porosity predictors for fluvial sand-gravel mixtures. In order to do so, porosity measurements were done in the Rhine River, using a diving bell to allow undisturbed sampling under water. In addition, laboratory experiments were conducted, and porosity data from literature were reanalyzed. Measured porosity values range from 0.06 to 0.48. Our study shows that predictors based on the median grain size, the deviation from the Fuller curve, or the sediment standard deviation are unable to reproduce the observed variation in porosity. Predictors based on the entire grain size distribution perform better but are biased and have a large prediction error. This suggests that they do not account correctly for the grain size effect on porosity. On the other hand, parameters such as grain shape and the mechanism of deposition probably also have a distinct influence on porosity. Slightly more accurate predictions can be obtained with tailor-made predictors for the river under interest. Multivariate regression analysis on the Rhine data set produced a predictor with two independent parameters: the sediment standard deviation and the number of grains smaller than 0.5 mm, representing grain mixing effects and adhesion effects, respectively. Despite the shortcomings, porosity predictors provide valuable insights in the spatial variation in porosity, which is demonstrated in a case study for the Rhine River.},

  abstract = {The river bed of the Rhine River is subject to severe erosion and sedimentation. Such high geomorphological process rates are unwanted for economical, ecological, and safety reasons. The objectives of this study were (1) to quantify the geomorphological development of the Rhine River between 1985 and 2006; (2) to investigate the bed erosion process; and (3) to distinguish between tectonic, hydrological, and human controls. We used a unique data set with thousands of bedload and suspended-load measurements and quantified the fluxes of gravel, sand, silt, and clay through the northern Upper Rhine Graben and the Rhenish Massif. Furthermore, we calculated bed level changes and evaluated the sediment budget of the channel. Sediment transport rates were found to change in the downstream direction: silt and clay loads increase because of tributary supply; sand loads increase because of erosion of sand from the bed; and gravel loads decrease because of reduced sediment mobility caused by the base-level control exerted by the uplifting Rhenish Massif. This base-level control shows tectonic setting, in addition to hydrology and human interventions, to represent a major control on morphodynamics in the Rhine. The Rhine bed appears to be in a state of disequilibrium, with an average net bed degradation of 3mm/a. Sand being eroded from the bed is primarily washed away in suspension, indicating a rapid supply of sand to the Rhine delta. The degradation is the result of an increased sediment transport capacity caused by nineteenth and twentieth century's river training works. In order to reduce degradation, huge amounts of sediment are fed into the river by river managers. Bed degradation and artificial sediment feeding represent the major sources of sand and gravel to the study area; only small amounts of sediment are supplied naturally from upstream or by tributaries. Sediment sinks include dredging, abrasion, and the sediment output to the downstream area. Large uncertainties exist about the amounts of sediment deposited on floodplains and in groyne fields. Compared to the natural situation during the middle Holocene, the present-day gravel and sand loads seem to be lower, whereas the silt and clay loads seem to be higher. This is probably caused by the present-day absence of meander migration, the deforestation, and the reduced sediment trapping efficiency of the floodplains. Even under natural conditions no equilibrium bed level existed.},

  abstract = {The stability of river channels and their suitability as habitat for aqueous organisms is strongly controlled by the rate of bedload transport. Quantification of bedload transport rates in rivers is difficult, not only because of the temporal variation in transport, but also because of the cross-channel variation in transport. The objectives of this study were: (i) to determine the effect of cross-channel variation in bedload transport on the uncertainty of width-integrated transport rates; and to use this knowledge (ii) to improve guidelines for bedload sampling. This was done through a thorough statistical evaluation of stochastic and systematic uncertainties involved in bed-load transport measurements. Based on this evaluation, new guidelines are presented for determination of the number of samples and sampling positions across the channel that are required for bedload measurements in several types of sand-bed rivers and gravel-bed rivers. The guidelines relate to bedload measurements made with pressure-difference (Helley-Smith type) samplers that require numerous bedload samples of short duration at several positions across the channel. The results show that generally more sampling positions across the channel are required in gravel-bed rivers than in sand-bed rivers. For gravel-bed rivers with unknown cross-channel distribution of transport, at least 10 sampling positions are recommended, whereas for most sand-bed rivers five positions suffice. In addition, at least 12 short-duration samples are required at each position to obtain bedload estimates with uncertainties below 20\%. If the same level of uncertainty is desired in the case of high spatial and temporal variation in transport rates, the number of short-duration samples needed per sampling position increases to 40.},

  abstract = {While many studies have documented pathways of river degradation, few studies have assessed the character, capacity, and stages of river recovery. In this paper, a generic procedure to measure river recovery is developed and applied in Bega catchment, on the south coast of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The approach is based on analysis of geomorphic units and ergodic reasoning. Historical data and field analyses are used to identify stages of river evolution throughout Bega catchment. From this, stages of river condition and pathways of adjustment are assessed for three river styles at different positions within the catchment. Five categories of river condition are identified. Intact reaches operate in a self-adjusting manner, whereby processes maintain the pre-disturbance geomorphic character of the reach. The processes occurring in restoration reaches maintain and enhance the geomorphic structure of the reach. These reaches are moderately resilient to change. The river has experienced degradation, but has recovered to a condition approximating its pre-disturbance character and behavior. Degraded reaches are still adjusting to disturbance and the processes of recovery have not yet begun. The river is experiencing progressive deterioration away from the structure and function of the pre-disturbance condition. Turning-point reaches are at the transitional stage where they can either recover or revert to a degraded state. Finally, a creation reach has a self-adjusting character and behavior but operates under altered catchment boundary conditions. The character and behavior of the river do not equate to pre-disturbance conditions; rather, the river is well adjusted to the prevailing catchment boundary conditions of water and sediment transfer, and vegetation cover and composition (among many factors). Once these conditions have been identified for each river style, all reaches in a catchment are placed on pathways of degradation and recovery, and predictions made about their direction of change. The three river styles analyzed in Bega catchment demonstrate differing recovery pathways. Some reaches are adjusting toward a restored condition, while others are adjusting toward a new (or creation) condition. The geomorphic recovery potential of each reach is determined by assessing the connectivity of reaches throughout the catchment and interpreting limiting factors to recovery (e.g., water and sediment transfer, vegetation and coarse woody debris [CWD] character and distribution).

The results showed that the average cell soil loss decreased from 11.09 to 3.10 t/ha yr for the whole watershed and from 17.67 to 3.89 t/ha yr for the croplands under the no-till scenario. Likewise, the average cell sediment yield decreased from 4.71 to 1.49 t/ha yr for the entire watershed and from 7.11 to 1.55 t/ha yr for the croplands under no-till practices.

The solid field is assumed to consist of several arbitrarily-shaped, undeformable but mobile rigid bodies, that are evolved in time individually and allowed to get into mechanical contact with each other. The fluid field generally consists of multiple liquid or gas phases. All fields are spatially discretized using the method of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). This approach is especially suitable in the context of continually changing interface topologies and dynamic phase transitions without the need for additional methodological and computational effort for interface tracking as compared to mesh- or grid-based methods. Proposing a concept for the parallelization of the computational framework, in particular concerning a computationally efficient evaluation of rigid body motion, is an essential part of this work. Finally, the accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by several numerical examples in two and three dimensions, involving multiple rigid bodies, two-phase flow, and reversible phase transitions, with a focus on two potential application scenarios in the fields of engineering and biomechanics: powder bed fusion additive manufacturing (PBFAM) and disintegration of food boluses in the human stomach. The efficiency of the parallel computational framework is demonstrated by a strong scaling analysis.},

Considering previous comparative studies, our initial hypothesis is that both OpenFOAMs' multiphase solver and FLOW-3D provide good comparable results. In this study, in contrast to previous comparative studies, turbulence was addressed using LES approach and the volume of fluid method was used to model the multiphase interface (air-water). Mesh independency was assessed through LES IQ index and the numerical models' accuracies were evaluated comparing representative hydraulic variables (velocity, its components, and turbulence kinetic energy) with ADV experimental data and discussing results in previous studies. Both platform codes reproduced the scenario under study, concurred with experimental data and offered a superior performance on flow structure velocity simulation than turbulent kinetic energy. Results validate the use of the free and open platform OpenFOAM as a viable alternative to commercial ones in the domain of fishway design and assessment. While OpenFOAM provides a reliable free alternative, FLOW-3D has a faster setup and makes the simulating experience apt for beginners.},

First, equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) are modeled using idealized meteorological variables. Modeled climatic conditions (summer mean temperature and annual precipitation) at the ELA of glaciers located within a winter accumulation pattern confirm the observational results of earlier studies. However, the ELA of glaciers located within a summer accumulation climate pattern locates in a colder environment than that of glaciers located within a winter accumulation climate pattern. This difference is mainly due to the annual snow accumulation and the surface albedo. A warming test (+1K) reveals higher sensitivities for the glaciers located within a summer accumulation pattern than for the glaciers located within a winter accumulation pattern. In a humid environment, a significant decrease in snow accumulation on the glaciers located within a summer accumulation pattern directly causes higher sensitivities. In an arid environment, on the other hand, the decreased summer snow induces accelerated melting by lowering the surface albedo and thus increasing absorption of solar radiation on the glaciers located within a summer accumulation pattern. Both influences are due to significant differences in summer precipitation. This study shows the importance of precipitation seasonality on the climatic sensitivity of glacier mass balance, which in previous studies has been linked only with annual precipitation.},

Local rates of bend migration measured normal to the channel centerline are then proportional to the local flow asymmetry. The average migration rate for a bend can be related to its average curvature by integrating the effects of curvature and associated bed forms over bend length.

Both theoretical aspects of LES and examples of LES predictions in the fields of aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and combustion are discussed. Comparisons with experimental data, or for simpler flows with direct numerical simulation data, are presented to demonstrate both the strengths and the weaknesses of LES. In general, LES provides a very powerful computational tool for fluid mechanics that can and should be used together with other simpler simulation models and experiments to advance the understanding of fluid flow and to aid the design of engineering systems.

Based on a systematic review of the literature, our best estimates for sustainable global NET potentials in 2050 are 0.5{\textendash}3.6 GtCO2 yr-1 for afforestation and reforestation, 0.5{\textendash}5 GtCO2 yr-1 for BECCS, 0.5{\textendash}2 GtCO2 yr-1 for biochar, 2{\textendash}4 GtCO2 yr-1 for enhanced weathering, 0.5{\textendash}5 GtCO2 yr-1 for DACCS, and up to 5 GtCO2 yr-1 for soil carbon sequestration. Costs vary widely across the technologies, as do their permanency and cumulative potentials beyond 2050. It is unlikely that a single NET will be able to sustainably meet the rates of carbon uptake described in integrated assessment pathways consistent with 1.5 {\textdegree}C of global warming.},

It delivers public domain data in raster format. The main disadvantage of the MODIS sensor is that it is unable to record observations under cloud covered regions. This is why this study focuses on estimating the pixel cover for cloud covered areas where no information is available. Our step to this product involves employing methodology based on six successive steps that estimate the pixel cover using different temporal and spatial information. The study was carried out for the Kokcha River basin located in northeastern part of Afghanistan. Snow coverage in catchments, like Kokcha, is very important where the melt-water from snow dominates the river discharge in vegetation period for irrigation purposes. Since no snow related observations were available from the region, the performance of the proposed methodology was tested using the cloud generated MODIS snow cover data as possible "ground truth" information. The results show successful performances arising from the methods applied, which resulted in all cloud coverage being removed. A validation was carried out for all subsequent steps, to be outlined below, where each step removes progressively more cloud coverage. Steps 2 to 5 (step 1 was not validated) performed very well with an average accuracy of between 90{\textendash}96\%, when applied one after another for the selected valid days in this study. The sixth step was the least accurate at 78\%, but it led to the removal of all remaining cloud cover.}

  abstract = {The modern erosion rate of continental-scale mountains is difficult to estimate and is usually based on measurement of the suspended load flux of rivers combined with assumptions about river bedload transport and sedimentation in flood plains. These two parameters are very difficult to measure directly in continental-scale basins. In this paper we examine the chemical composition of the suspended load, bedload, and dissolved load of the Ganga and Brahmaputra Rivers and compare them with the average composition of Himalayan source rocks. A mass-balance equation of erosion fluxes shows that a Si-rich component is needed in addition to suspended and dissolved load fluxes to account for the composition of the source rock. It corresponds to bedload sediment and flood-plain deposits, which are enriched in quartz by mineral sorting during transport. The combined budget of Si, Al, and Fe in the river system allows us to estimate this Si-rich flux. By this method, the total Himalayan erosion is estimated to be twice the measured flux of suspended load. The comparison between the Brahmaputra and the Ganga shows that the eastern Himalaya has a higher erosion rate (2.9 mm/yr) than the western Himalaya (2.1 mm/yr). This is likely the result of the higher runoff in the Brahmaputra basin. The intensity of the monsoon acts as a first-order control of the erosion rate in the range.}

The calibration of quality models is, in most cases, based on conventionally obtained calibration data, e.g., by automated sampling. Long-term high-resolution online measurement data are available for the Graz West catchment (Graz, Austria), allowing an assessment of the full dynamics of discharge and pollution concentrations. This paper focuses on the application and comparison of single-event and two different multievent optimization schemes for sewer-water quality model calibration. While both single- and multievent optimization lead to satisfying results for the calibration events in discharge calibration, it is shown that validation events are better reproduced by using multievent calibration. Single- and multievent autocalibration of pollution concentration is based on the best dataset obtained from the discharge calibration. As for discharge, the pollutographs are reproduced satisfactorily, and multievent calibration is more stable. In all cases, the two multievent approaches performed equally well.

  abstract = {The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 {$\mu$}m and a near-IR channel around 0.86 {$\mu$}m. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely, the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as ({$\varrho$}(0.86 {$\mu$}m) - {$\varrho$}(1.24 {$\mu$}m))({$\varrho$}(0.86 {$\mu$}m) + {$\varrho$}(1.24 {$\mu$}m)), where {$\varrho$} represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-{$\mu$}m and the 1.24-{$\mu$}m channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 {$\mu$}m is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 {$\mu$}m is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86{\textendash}1.24 {$\mu$}m region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24-{$\mu$}m channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 {$\mu$}m, NDWI should be considered as an independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance spectra of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given.}

Each product of the Theia Snow collection contains four classes: snow, no snow, cloud and no data. We present the algorithm to generate the snow products and provide an evaluation of the accuracy of Sentinel-2 snow products using in situ snow depth measurements, higher-resolution snow maps and visual control. The results suggest that the snow is accurately detected in the Theia snow collection and that the snow detection is more accurate than the Sen2Cor outputs (ESA level 2 product). An issue that should be addressed in a future release is the occurrence of false snow detection in some large clouds.

Deforestation, improper cultivation and uncontrolled grazing have resulted in accelerated soil erosion. Information on soil loss is essential to support agricultural productivity and natural resource management. Thus, this study was aimed to estimate and map the mean annual soil loss by using GIS and Remote sensing techniques. The soil loss was estimated by using Revised Universal Soil Equation (RUSLE) model. Topographic map of 1:50,000 scale, Aster Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of 20 m spatial resolution, digital soil map of 1:250,000 scale, thirteen years rainfall records of four stations, and land sat imagery (TM) with spatial resolution of 30 m was used to derive RUSLE's soil loss variables. The RUSLE parameters were analyzed and integrated using raster calculator in the geo-processing tools in ArcGIS 10.1 environment to estimate and map the annual soil loss of the study area. The result revealed that the annual soil loss of the watershed extends from none in the lower and middle part of the watershed to 265 t ha{\`A}1 year{\`A}1 in the steeper slope part of the watershed with a mean annual soil loss of 47 t ha{\`A}1 year{\`A}1. The total annual soil loss in the watershed was 255283 t, of these, 181801 (71\%) tones cover about 6691 (24\%) hectare of land. Most of these soil erosion affected areas are spatially situated in the upper steepest slope part (inlet) of the watershed. These are areas where Nitosols and Alisols with higher soil erodibility character (0.25) values are dominant. Hence, Slope gradient and length followed by soil erodibility factors were found to be the main factors of soil erosion. Thus, sustainable soil and water conservation practices should be adopted in steepest upper part of the study area by respecting and recognizing watershed logic, people and watershed potentials.},

  abstract = {Despite mounting demand for a more sustainable worldwide water supply system, available reservoir capacity is relentlessly diminishing due to sedimentation. Neither sustainable reservoir life spans nor intergenerational equity is achieved through conventional cost-benefit analyses (CBAs), which render all benefits and costs projected to occur more than several decades into a project as negligible. Consequently, future costs, including dam decommissioning or retrofitting with sediment management facilities, would be regarded as nonfactors in an analysis. CBAs have also historically failed to account for infrastructure and environmental impacts of sedimentation over time. Alternatives to the traditional application of the CBA do exist, however, such as dam owners instituting retirement funds or insurance policies, beneficiaries paying for rehabilitation or maintenance, and economists incorporating infrastructure damages and potentially logistic discount rates into their analyses. A brief case study of Gavins Point Dam shows that available information on damages due to a lack of sediment management account for 70\% of the actual construction cost and would likely exceed construction costs if all damage information were available. By integrating these alternatives, economic analyses for reservoirs will be more accurate, reservoir life spans will be more sustainable, profits will be extended indefinitely, and the economic burdens placed on future generations will be lessened.},

In this work, we describe a novel approach for reusing previously acquired knowledge by using it to guide the exploration of an agent while it learns new tasks. In order to do so, we employ a variant of the growing self-organizing map algorithm, which is trained using a measure of similarity that is defined directly in the space of the vectorized representations of the value functions. In addition to enabling transfer across tasks, the resulting map is simultaneously used to enable the efficient storage of previously acquired task knowledge in an adaptive and scalable manner. We empirically validate our approach in a simulated navigation environment and also demonstrate its utility through simple experiments using a mobile micro-robotics platform. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of this approach and analytically examine its relation to the proposed network growth mechanism. Furthermore, we briefly discuss some of the possible improvements and extensions to this approach, as well as its relevance to real-world scenarios in the context of continual learning.},

We discuss in detail the instantaneous flow structures and present results for the first- and second-order statistics of the flow quantities, and for the budget of the turbulent kinetic energy. Further, we present results of the power spectral density of the velocity and temperature signals at selected locations of the flow field. Our analysis elucidates the properties of the important features of the flow such as the large recirculation bubble and the secondary separation zones that are formed in the vicinity of the entry of the jet. According to our simulations, thermal mixing is mainly driven by the shear layer between the two streams and, to a lesser extent, by the shear layer between the incoming jet and the large recirculation bubble. Thermal mixing is further enhanced by turbulence generation in the regions of adverse pressure gradients downstream of the large recirculation bubble. Within the framework of our study, we have also conducted a wall-resolved large-eddy simulation (LES) of the flow of interest so as to assess its predictive capacity. Overall, the LES predictions agree satisfactorily with our DNS data; the most noticeable discrepancy is that the LES produces mildly diffused profiles for the second-order statistics in the regions of intense turbulence production.},

  abstract = {In order to contribute to a reliable, easy-to-handle and economically viable erosion risk assessment of contaminated riverine sites, the present study alms to implement master-variables best characterising the sediment stability. Thus, a wide range of sediment properties was related to the critical shear stress for mass erosion, determined in the SETEG (Stroemungskanal zur Ermittlung der tiefenabhaengigen Erosionsstabilitaet von Gewaessersedimenten) pressurised channel, with special emphasis on vertical and temporal gradients in the Lauffen reservoir on the River Neckar. Over the course of I year, positive impacts of some macrofauna species and benthic diatoms on the sediment stability were detected for the sediment surface (0.5 cm). However, a high seasonal variability of biological parameters caused varying relations with erosion resistance in the upper sediment layers as shown for the colloidal carbohydrates. Considering only deeper sediment layers (5-35 cm), a more general pattern could be revealed with correlations between the critical shear stress and single sediment properties such as depth, grain size, total organic carbon (TOC), cation exchange coefficient (CEC), carbohydrates and proteins. Firstly, the influence of physico-chemical and biological properties on erosion resistance became evident, even over depths at 0-35 cm. Secondly, inter-particle forces are most important for erosion resistance. These are enhanced in fine-grained sediment layers, offering high binding capacities but also strengthened by polymeric substances permeating the void space and coating particles. These covariance patterns of sedimentological and biological parameters are addressed by multivariate statistical tests (principal component analysis), resulting in a higher magnitude of the correlation coefficient between critical shear stress and the master-variables in main component 11 (polymeric substances, grain size, TOC, CEC R = 0.77) compared to single correlations.

  abstract = {Biofilm activities and their interactions with physical, chemical and biological processes are of great importance for a variety of ecosystem functions, impacting hydrogeomorphology, water quality and aquatic ecosystem health. Effective management of water bodies requires advancing our understanding of how flow influences biofilm-bound sediment and ecosystem processes and vice-versa. However, research on this triangle of flow-biofilm-sediment is still at its infancy. In this Review, we summarize the current state of the art and methodological approaches in the flow-biofilm-sediment research with an emphasis on biostabilization and fine sediment dynamics mainly in the benthic zone of lotic and lentic environments. Example studies of this three-way interaction across a range of spatial scales from cell (nm {\textendash} {\textmu}m) to patch scale (mm {\textendash} dm) are highlighted in view of the urgent need for interdisciplinary approaches. As a contribution to the review, we combine a literature survey with results of a pilot experiment that was conducted in the framework of a joint workshop to explore the feasibility of asking interdisciplinary questions. Further, within this workshop various observation and measuring approaches were tested and the quality of the achieved results was evaluated individually and in combination. Accordingly, the paper concludes by highlighting the following research challenges to be considered within the forthcoming years in the triangle of flow-biofilm-sediment: i) Establish a collaborative work among hydraulic and sedimentation engineers as well as ecologists to study mutual goals with appropriate methods. Perform realistic experimental studies to test hypotheses on flow-biofilm-sediment interactions as well as structural and mechanical characteristics of the bed. ii) Consider spatially varying characteristics of flow at the sediment-water interface. Utilize combinations of microsensors and non-intrusive optical methods, such as particle image velocimetry and laser scanner to elucidate the mechanism behind biofilm growth as well as mass and momentum flux exchanges between biofilm and water. Use molecular approaches (DNA, pigments, staining, microscopy) for sophisticated community analyses. Link varying flow regimes to microbial communities (and processes) and fine sediment properties to explore the role of key microbial players and functions in enhancing sediment stability (biostabilization). iii) Link laboratory-scale observations to larger scales relevant for management of water bodies. Conduct field experiments to better understand the complex effects of variable flow and sediment regimes on biostabilization. Employ scalable and informative observation techniques (e.g., hyperspectral imaging, particle tracking) that can support predictions on the functional aspects, such as metabolic activity, bed stability, nutrient fluxes under variable regimes of flow-biofilm-sediment.},

De St. Venant equations assume uniform velocity and hydrostatic pressure distributions. They are thus applicable only to cases of meandering rivers and curved open channels where vertical details are not of importance. The two-dimensional vertically averaged and moment equations model, developed by the writers, is used to study the effect of applying different distribution shapes for velocities and pressure on the simulation of curved open channels. Linear and quadratic distribution shapes are proposed for the horizontal velocity components, while a quadratic distribution shape is considered for the vertical velocity. Linear hydrostatic and quadratic nonhydrostatic distribution shapes are proposed for the pressure. The proposed model is applied to problems involved in curved open channels with different degrees of curvature. The implicit Petrov{\textendash}Galerkin finite element scheme is applied in this study. Computed values for depth averaged longitudinal and transverse velocities across the channel width and vertical profiles of longitudinal and transverse velocities are compared to the observed experimental data. A fairly good agreement is attained. Predictions of overall flow characteristics suggest that the results are not very sensitive to different approximations of the preassumed applied velocity and pressure distribution shapes.},

The 3-dimensional flow pattern in a river bend with a lateral or tributary channel is not only affected by the centrifugal force and pressure gradient but is also affected by the tributary channel's momentum. Understanding this phenomenon requires extensive research: in this study the effect of 4 tributary junction angles, placed at a 45{\textdegree} angle from the beginning of the bend, is studied using SSIIM1 software. The effect of the junction angle on the vertical and transverse velocity profile, water level changes in the main channel, bed shear-stress distribution and secondary flow strength were evaluated. The results showed that by increasing the junction angle from 30{\textdegree} to 115{\textdegree} the streamwise velocity in the vicinity of the centre line and the inner wall of the bend increases. Increasing the junction angle also increases the separation zone dimensions, maximum bed shear stress, difference between the upstream and downstream water level in the junction and the secondary flow strength.},

Parameters such as water surface level, the transverse and depth velocity distribution, secondary flow and separation zones deeply depend on bend angel and radius, while many researchers are interested in flow patterns at bends. This paper presents an experimental and numerical study of the flow patterns in a strongly-curved 90{\textordmasculine} open channel bend. The numerical modelling was carried out using the finite volume method. In this numerical study, the k   (RNG) model was used to predict the turbulence, and the volume of fluid (VOF) method was used to simulate the water free surface. The numerical results were verified against data from a program of experiments conducted in this study. A comparison between the experimental data and the results of the numerical model showed that the k   (RNG) and VOF methods are capable of simulating the flow pattern in the strongly-curved bends. The results showed that along a strongly-curved 90{\textordmasculine} bend, the maximum flow velocity always occurs near the inner wall and in such bends the effect of the secondary flows is not limited to the sections within the bend. Also the overall shape of streamlines along the bend and at different water levels is different. In addition, the results revealed that the transverse slope of the water surface is non-linear in these bends. This situation occurs in bends even though maintaining a steady uniform flow condition in straight sections.},

To verify the numerical model, a 90  sharp bend was first modeled with a three-dimensional numerical model, and the results were compared with available experimental results. Based on the numerical model validation, a 120  bend was simulated. The results show that the rate of increase of the water depth at the cross-section located 40 cm before the bend, compared with the cross-sections located 40 cm and 80 cm after the bend, decreases with the increase of the normal water depth in the 120  curved channel. Moreover, with increasing normal water depth, the dimensionless water depth change decreases at all cross-sections. At the interior cross-sections of the bend, the transverse water depth slope of the inner half-width is always greater than that of the outer half-width of the channel. Hence, the water depth slope is nonlinear at each crosssection in sharp bends. Two equations reflecting the relationships between the maximum and minimum dimensionless water depths and the normal water depth throughout the channel were obtained.},

  abstract = {In meandering rivers, the flow behavior is very complex due to topography and flow depth changes. In general, effective forces on bend flow pattern include centrifugal force due to non-uniformity of the vertical velocity profile and radius pressure gradient induced by the lateral slope of water surface. In this paper, the 60{\textdegree} bend flow pattern is simulated by developing FLUENT computational software based on finite volume method (FVM), numerically. The k-{$\epsilon$} (RNG) turbulence model and volume of fluid (VOF) method are used for turbulence and flow depth modeling. The FVM numerical results are verified by existing experimental data in velocity and flow depth. The results illustrate that the FVM model has high accuracy in prediction flow variables in the bend. As the average value of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values between the observational and numerical results for depth-averaged velocity (DAV) in the different transverse profile are 4.5 and 9\%, respectively, which is an acceptable error percentage. The advanced software can well simulate the both major and minor secondary current cells with opposite rotation direction in the vicinity of channel bed and vicinity the water level in the outer wall, respectively. By the development of the major and minor secondary currents in sections located 40 (cm) after the bend, longitudinal velocity shift, and the high-velocity zone moves further to the outer wall (and the channel bed) in depth. Therefore, it can be said the developing FLUENT software can be utilized in practical cases in design and execution of curved channel.},

  abstract = {Hybridization in context to Evolutionary Computation (EC) aims at combining the operators and methodologies from different EC paradigms to form a single algorithm that may enjoy a statistically superior performance on a wide variety of optimization problems. In this article we propose an efficient hybrid evolutionary algorithm that embeds the difference vector-based mutation scheme, the crossover and the selection strategy of Differential Evolution (DE) into another recently developed global optimization algorithm known as Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES). CMA-ES is a stochastic method for real parameter (continuous domain) optimization of non-linear, non-convex functions. The algorithm includes adaptation of covariance matrix which is basically an alternative method of traditional Quasi-Newton method for optimization based on gradient method. The hybrid algorithm, referred by us as Differential Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Algorithm (DCMA-EA), turns out to possess a better blending of the explorative and exploitative behaviors as compared to the original DE and original CMAES, through empirical simulations. Though CMA-ES has emerged itself as a very efficient global optimizer, its performance deteriorates when it comes to dealing with complicated fitness landscapes, especially landscapes associated with noisy, hybrid composition functions and many real world optimization problems. In order to improve the overall performance of CMA-ES, the mutation, crossover and selection operators of DE have been incorporated into CMA-ES to synthesize the hybrid algorithm DCMA-EA. We compare DCMA-EA with original DE and CMA-EA, two best known DE-variants: SaDE and JADE, and two state-of-the-art real optimizers: IPOP-CMA-ES (Restart Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy with increasing population size) and DMS-PSO (Dynamic Multi Swarm Particle Swarm Optimization) over a test-suite of 20 shifted, rotated, and compositional benchmark functions and also two engineering optimization problems. Our comparative study indicates that although the hybridization scheme does not impose any serious burden on DCMA-EA in terms of number of Function Evaluations (FEs), DCMA-EA still enjoys a statistically superior performance over most of the tested benchmarks and especially over the multi-modal, rotated, and compositional ones in comparison to the other algorithms considered here.},

  abstract = {Soil erosion is addressed as one of the main hydrogeological risks in the European Union. Since the average annual soil loss rate exceeds the annual average formation rate, soil is considered as a non-renewable resource. Besides, human activities, human-induced forces and climate change have further accelerated the erosion processes. Therefore, understanding soil erosion spatial and temporal trends could provide important information for supporting government land-use policies and strategies for its reduction. This paper describes the Dynamic Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (D-RUSLE) model, a modified version of the well-known RUSLE model. The RUSLE model formulation was modified to include variations in rainfall erosivity and land-cover to provide more accurate estimates of the potential soil erosion in the Italian Alps. Specifically, the modelling of snow occurrence and the inclusion of Earth Observation data allow dynamic estimation of both spatial and temporal land-cover changes. Results obtained in Val Camonica (Italy) show that RUSLE model tends to overestimate erosion rates in Autumn/Winter because not considering snow cover and vegetation dynamics. The assimilation of satellite-derived information in D-RUSLE allows a better representation of soil erosion forcing, thus proving a more accurate erosion estimate for supporting government land-use policies and strategies for reducing this phenomenon.},

Moreover, since our discretization matrix is symmetric, it can be inverted rather quickly as opposed to the more complicated nonsymmetric discretization matrices found in other second-order-accurate discretizations of this problem. Multidimensional computational results are presented to demonstrate the second-order accuracy of this numerical method. In addition, we use our approach to formulate a second-order-accurate symmetric implicit time discretization of the heat equation on irregular domains. Then we briefly consider Stefan problems.}

The principal feature of the method is the use of statistical techniques to recover analytical expressions for the physical variables from a known distribution of fluid elements. The equations of motion take the form of Newtonian equations for particles. Starting with a non-axisymmetric distribution of approximately 80 particles in three dimensions, the method is found to reproduce the structure of uniformly rotating and magnetic polytropes to within a few per cent. The method may be easily extended to deal with more complicated physical models.}

The paper gives an overview of the model configurations, experiments related forcings, and initialization procedures and presents results for the simulated changes in climate and carbon cycle. It is found that the climate feedback depends on the global warming and possibly the forcing history. The global warming from climatological 1850 conditions to 2080{\textendash}2100 ranges from 1.5{\textdegree}C under the RCP2.6 scenario to 4.4{\textdegree}C under the RCP8.5 scenario. Over this range, the patterns of temperature and precipitation change are nearly independent of the global warming. The model shows a tendency to reduce the ocean heat uptake efficiency toward a warmer climate, and hence acceleration in warming in the later years. The precipitation sensitivity can be as high as 2.5\% K-1 if the CO2 concentration is constant, or as small as 1.6\% K-1, if the CO2 concentration is increasing. The oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon increases over time in all scenarios, being smallest in the experiment forced by RCP2.6 and largest in that for RCP8.5. The land also serves as a net carbon sink in all scenarios, predominantly in boreal regions. The strong tropical carbon sources found in the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 experiments are almost absent in the RCP4.5 experiment, which can be explained by reforestation in the RCP4.5 scenario.},

  abstract = {Fundamental transitions in natural resources technologies, institutions, and management approaches are often difficult to see in advance, or even in the midst, of actual changes. Such a transformation now appears to be underway for freshwater resources, driven by increasingly severe water-related crises around the world. These include mismatches between supply and demand; the continued failure to meet basic human needs for water and sanitation; expanding ecological degradation due to extraction of water from natural systems and human-caused climate changes; the development of new technologies for using, treating, monitoring, and reporting on water use; new conceptual work; and growing attention given to water issues by the public and scientific communities. Similar transitions, with additional implications for water, also appear to be underway in the energy and climate fields. For such transitions to be successful, it is important to understand what drives deep changes in the perceptions, management, and use of natural resources; the factors that encourage or discourage changes; and whether strategies can be developed to improve and accelerate those changes that lead to social, economic, and environmental sustainability goals. This paper addresses the concept of resource or environmental transitions in the context of freshwater; reviews theories, data, and frameworks for identifying and analyzing transitions; offers some examples; and identifies key policies to help manage effective and successful transitions.},

  abstract = {For centuries, scientists have been attempting to map complex hydraulic processes to empirical formulas using different flow resistance definitions, which are further applied in numerical models. Now questions arise as to how consistent the simulated results are between the model dimensions and what influence different morphologies and flow conditions have. For this reason, 1D, 2D and 3D simulations were performed and compared with each other in three study areas with up to three different discharges. A standardized, relative comparison of the models shows that after successful calibration at measured water levels, the associated 2D/1D and 3D/1D ratios are almost unity, while bed shear stresses in the 3D models are only about 62{\textendash}86\% of the simulated 1D values and 90{\textendash}100\% in the case of 2D/1D. Reasons for this can be found in different roughness definitions, in simplified geometries, in different calculation approaches, as well as in influences of the turbulence closure. Moreover, decreasing 3D/1D ratios of shear stresses were found with increasing discharges and with increasing slopes, while the equivalent 2D/1D ratios remain almost unchanged. The findings of this study should be taken into account, particularly in subsequent sediment transport simulations, as these calculations are often based on shear stresses.},

  abstract = {Dredging in the rivers of the Ardenne is generally carried out on a smaller scale to that described in the literature and is not conducted for commercial purposes. Extractions within the river channel are made in order to prevent flooding; hence the quantity of gravel extracted is limited. This study aims to evaluate the impact of dredging and the resilience of the riverbed in the Semois. This river is found in the south of the Ardenne region and is characterized by large incised meanders, a narrow floodplain, few pebble bars, numerous bedrock outcrops and a limited stock of sediment. The bed is particularly flat and shallow and the bankfull discharge (130 m3 s{\`A}1) is frequently attained (0.9 yr). Pebble tracers allowed the critical parameters (discharge, Shields criterion, and stream power), the diameter of mobilized sediment and the distance of sediment transport to be determined. A major dredging campaign resulted in the formation of a channel nearly 1 km long and 2 m deep which functioned as a sediment trap. Topographical cross-sections made before and after the dredging campaign and again 4 yr later allowed bedload discharge to be estimated (1.1 t km{\`A}1 yr{\`A}1). In order to examine the efficiency of the sediment trap, the sediment transport equations of Meyer-Peter and Mu{\textasciidieresis}ller, Schoklitsch, Bagnold and Martin were applied. With the exception of Bagnold's equation (1980), the observed transport values and those calculated theoretically are relatively close. Between October 1997 and June 2001, 5010 t were caught in the sediment trap. For the same period the equations calculate values between 6147 and 10 571 t. The overestimation from the theoretical calculations may result from a lack of sediment supply due to the characteristics of the basin and the frequency and magnitude of flood events during the study period. From the magnitude of the sediment transport rate, a return to the initial state of the riverbed (before dredging) may be expected after approximately 10 yr. Despite the scale of the dredging campaign for a river of this size, its results are limited in terms of flood prevention. Copyright \# 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {During the last decades, a number of methods have been developed for the estimation of hydrologic model parameters. One frequently used and relatively simple algorithm is the parameter estimation (PEST) method. A close examination of this algorithm shows that it is very similar to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The differences between the methods are caused by the derivation of the algorithms: the EKF is derived through a minimization of the square difference between the true and the estimated model state, while PEST has been derived through a minimization of an objective function related to, but not equal to, the root mean square error between the model results and the observations. The objective of this paper is to analyze the performance of these two algorithms. A synthetic-data experiment has been developed for this purpose. It has been found that under high observation errors and/or temporally sparse observations the EKF can lead to a stable parameter estimation, while it is possible that under the same circumstances PEST does not yield a solution. Also, the choice of the initial guess for the parameter values can be an important issue in the application of PEST, while this is not so important for the EKF. The application of the Marquardt algorithm can lead to stable parameter estimates in case the PEST algorithm fails (meaning that nonphysical parameter values were obtained which lead to a premature abortion of the model simulations), but numerically the EKF is still superior. In order to solve this problem, a simple alternative to the Marquardt algorithm has been developed, which leads to a quicker convergence.},

Model results have to be compared against measured data in order to assess their accuracy in operational conditions.

In particular, calibration aims at simulating a series of reference events by adjusting some uncertain physically based parameters until the comparison is as accurate as possible. Calibration is critical to all projects based on numerical models as it requires a very large proportion of the project lifetime. In this study, the Python module TelApy of the TELEMAC system (www.opentelemac.org) has been used with the ADAO library of the SALOME platform (www.salome-platform.org) to automatically calibrate a 2D hydraulic model. based on a 3DVAR data assimilation algorithm.

To evaluate the accuracy of the SCE technique for extracting the intrinsic PV parameters, a comparison with other well-known methods is presented; in particular, analytic method, Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt, genetic algorithms (GA), differential evolution (DE), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are considered. This comparison is performed by using statistical analysis and by estimating the relative error of parameter values; it has been applied to an unknown PV module and to a known PV cell. The obtained results showed that, compared with other evolutionary methods (GA, DE and PSO), the SCE presents the lowest computational time and requires less iterations/generations to converge. All the results prove that the proposed method is feasible, faster, and presents better results than the conventional ones.},

To this end, the test data are restricted to ones obtained in approximately steady flow when the material in motion was similar to that present on the bed; that is, transport was not size selective. This represents the nearest approach to ``equilibrium sediment transport'' that can be realized with available data. Four sets of river data and three sets of flume data were chosen for the test, covering a range of eight orders of magnitude in unit bed load transport rate. The test data were not used in the development of the formulae. The analysis separates mean bias and local bias. No formula performs consistently well. Limitations of the test data, the constraints imposed by an operationally realistic test, and reasons based upon the physics of the transport phenomenon all may be adduced for this. To estimate the magnitude of transport with limited hydraulic information, stream power equations should be used because they provide the most straightforward scale correlation of the phenomenon. In particular, the approach of Bagnold deserves further study. When local hydraulic information is available, a formula should be selected that is sensitive to bed state or grain size distribution and, in this context, the formulae of Einstein, Parker, and Ackers-White-Day bear continued examination.},

Subsequent stream-wide measurements, that frequently incorporated lengthy collection periods, as well as the adoption of standardized sampling procedures, averaged out some temporal and spatial variability. However, continuous, highly resolved, long-period records of transport activity generated by active and passive bedload monitoring on diverse rivers have recently brought this variability into sharp focus. A defining characteristic of these `big data' is that there are many possible bedload transport rates for each discharge and a wide range of discharges associated with each transport rate. Crucially, this incoherent scatter, which is generated by the various factors that affect bedload transport, can no longer be viewed as `noise' that can be averaged out. We demonstrate that, even for small datasets, different methods of reporting and analysing bedload transport records provide different perspectives on the bedload transport rate{\textendash}flow relation. The inclusion/exclusion of zero values, present in all data that capture the intermittent nature of bedload transport, also affects the relation. To unlock the potential of big data and facilitate the development of bedload transport{\textendash}flow relations from field measurements, it is essential to employ modes of analysis that are robust to outliers and do not assume that associations between the independent and dependent variables are the same at all levels.},

  abstract = {The yield from fisheries and aquaculture production has risen dramatically over the last few decades, with rising demands to meet the needs of a growing world population that is also consuming more seafood per capita. Aquaculture products have, in recent years, also overtaken tonnage obtained from wild fisheries. This is particularly true for finfish species such as Atlantic salmon. However, the marine lifecycle stage for Atlantic salmon aquaculture requires ocean-based net pens, which introduces environmental vulnerabilities that can negatively affect production. Of particular concern is the ability of the fish to tolerate rising seawater temperatures in the face of climate change. One way of tackling this challenge is to incorporate selective breeding for Atlantic salmon families that display greater tolerance to elevated seawater temperatures. The goal of this study was to determine the genomic heritability of seawater temperature tolerance in Atlantic salmon and to investigate the genetic architecture of this trait for more effective broodstock management. We report a moderate genomic-based heritability for seawater temperature at mortality in Atlantic salmon (0.208~{$\pm~$}0.041) with a favourable correlation between growth traits (body mass and fork length) and seawater temperature at mortality. Our results also show that seawater temperature at mortality is a polygenic trait, with no significant quantitative trait loci identified. The moderate genomic heritability for seawater temperature at mortality suggests that this trait could be included in Atlantic salmon breeding programs. Importantly, the favourable correlation between growth traits and seawater temperature at mortality suggests that selection for seawater temperature tolerance would not have a negative impact on growth in this population. No single quantitative trait locus for seawater temperature at mortality was identified, suggesting that genomic selection will be required to achieve an increased tolerance to seawater temperature in this population.},

This study developed and evaluated a new spatially explicit method for analyzing discharge-dependent hydraulics coined {\dbend}hydraulic topography{\dbend} that not only increases accuracy but also eliminates several sample- and assumption-based inconsistencies. Using data and hydrodynamic simulations from the regulated, gravel{\dbend}cobble-bed lower Yuba River in California, power functions were fitted to discharge-dependent average width, depth, and depth-weighted velocity for three spatial scales and then their corresponding exponents and coefficients were compared across scales and against ones computed using traditional approaches. Average hydraulic values from cross sections at the segment scale spanned up to 1.5 orders of magnitude for a given discharge. Transect-determined exponents for reach-scale depth and velocity relations were consistently over- and underestimated, respectively, relative to the hydraulic topography benchmark. Overall, 73\% of cross-sectional power regression parameters assessed fell between 10 and 50 absolute percent error with respect to the spatially explicit hydraulic topography baseline. Although traditional transect-based sampling may be viable for certain uses, percent errors of this magnitude could compromise engineering applications in river management and training works.},

The investigations were conducted in sensitivity analyses adopting a 3D sediment transport model with Delft 3D. The impact of various physical and numerical parameters on temperature and fine sediment transport modeling was examined: the number of vertical layers, the input data for the heat model (e.g. relative humidity, air temperature, cloud coverage, solar radiation), the vertical diffusivity and wind effects. The sensitivity studies showed that the input data for the heat model have a minor impact on the temperature and sediment transport modeling within the tested range of parameters. However, the vertical diffusivity and especially the inclusion of wind showed a greater influence on the simulated temperature and suspended sediment concentration gradients. The temperature modeling results by inclusion/exclusion of wind were qualitatively compared with temperature data from literature and with measurement data over a period of one month. Hereby, the simulations showed a good agreement with measurement data by exclusion of wind effects.\&lt;/p\&gt;\&lt;p\&gt;The results of the studies provide a solid basis for the development of further models in fields where fine sediment transport is affected by stratification processes and can also be very useful in terms of a better understanding of the interactions between temperature, wind and fine sediment transport.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

Results reveal diverse interaction regimes between surges and mobile beds, including ``rigid bed'', ``lubrication'', ``shallow ploughing'', ``surfing'', ``plunging'', and ``deep ploughing''. Shallow, borderline-stable beds ``lubricate'' the surge: once destabilized, these beds cause strong acceleration of the combined flow front. Deeper borderline-stable beds allow the surge material to ``plunge'' downward, massively displacing bed material upward and downstream. For stabler beds, ``ploughing'' and ``surfing'' are associated with intermediate and high values of {$\tau$}y,b, respectively. In both cases, beds retard the surge, with mobile dams forming for ``ploughing'' regimes. Across all regimes identified, the influence of {$\tau$}y,b is non-monotonic, with intermediate values decelerating the combined flow fronts the most. Furthermore, the different interaction regimes exhibit unique velocity profiles. We develop phase diagrams based on three dimensionless numbers, demarcating these regimes.},

  abstract = {Physical heterogeneity is a major topic in river sciences because it is known to be a key factor for ecological integrity. In this paper, we investigated the hydraulic enviroment in an alpine gravel-bed stream with an unaltered hydrological regime. The study was based on the hypothesis that spatial and temporal variability are correlated to the morphological template of a stream. Numerical hydrodynamic modelling was conducted at five morphologically contrasting study sites for different discharges chosen from discharge duration curves. On the basis of the resulting hydraulic variables, namely flow velocity and water depth, and of a recently proposed hydromorphological index of diversity, the differences in spatial and temporal variability were analysed by descriptive statistics. Spatial diversity was higher at morphologically natural sites than at sites that were partially or fully regulated by resectioning and bank protection. Conversely, temporal variability in the hydraulic environment was higher at regulated sites where hydraulic variables were subject to fluctuations with each small discharge modification, which is not the case for more impaired sites. Unless higher discharges with bed reshaping activity occur, natural streams are characterized not only by high spatial variability but also by a sustained persistence of aquatic habitats. Therefore, river engineering projects aimed at enhancing habitat heterogeneity should not only focus on a higher spatial variability of the physical environment but also aim for greater persistence of aquatic habitats.

HMID is a new tool enabling quantitative assessments of river restoration alternatives on ecologically relevant scales. The model is able to characterize both the spatial and temporal hydrodynamic variability, in relation to morphological characteristics, and thereby to assess the overall physical habitat variability imparted by different restoration alternatives. Three habitat alternatives were evaluated (boulder clusters, groynes, alternating bars) and compared to existing conditions where a prismatic channel exists. The placement of boulder clusters represented the simplest and cheapest option to implement but produced marginal improvements in the aquatic habitat. Installation of groynes resulted in moderate increases to spatial habitat variability, resulting in the largest capital investment. The introduction of alternating bars within a modestly increased channel width produced the greatest increase in physical habitat diversity and thus morphodynamic complexity while resulting in moderate capital investment construction costs compared to a full geomorphic restoration. The alternating bar rehabilitation alternative also supported the greatest habitat diversity and lowest variation in hydraulic conditions under low-flow conditions.},

This study is part of a research project that is underway to model the transport of fine sediment and the associated nutrients in that river system. The erosion experimental data show that the critical shear stress for erosion of the upper River Taw sediment is about 0.09 Pa and it did not depend on the age of sediment deposit. The eroded sediment was transported in a flocculated form and the agent of flocculation for the upper River Taw sediment may be due to the presence of fibrils from microorganisms and organic material in the system. The experimental data were analysed using a curve fitting approach of Krone and a mathematical model of cohesive sediment transport in rotating circular flumes developed by Krishnappan. The modelled and measured data were in good agreement. An evaluation of the physical significance of Krone's fitting coefficients is presented. Variability of the fitting coefficients as a function of bed shear stress and age of sediment deposit indicate the key role these two factors play in the erosion process of fluvial cohesive sediment.},

  abstract = {Measures of cohesive sediment erodibility, such as erosion thresholds and rates, are essential for the development of accurate sediment transport models. In situ devices for erodibility quantification are increasingly being used to capture the high spatial and temporal variability in erodibility found in natural cohesive sediments. The cohesive strength meter (CSM) is a small, hand-held, commercially available device that has been used extensively in recent years to measure in situ erosion thresholds. However, the device is primarily used for relative measures of erosion thresholds, due to a difficulty in comparing the vertical forces generated by the CSM with horizontal bed shear stress. In this article, we describe the development of a methodology for the estimation of horizontal bed shear stress from CSM-derived erosion thresholds. The approach used cohesive sediment mixtures with varying clay contents to create sediments with a range of erodibilities and tested them using the CSM and a laboratory annular flume. A calibration is proposed based on a comparison of mean erosion thresholds from each device per clay treatment. This study is the first successful inter-comparison between CSM- and flume-derived erosion thresholds. Significant differences in erosion thresholds were noted between CSM routines, so it is recommended that the empirical calibration be applied only to erosion thresholds estimated using the Sand 1 routine, and ranging from 40-90 Pa stagnation pressure. The calibration allows the conversion of CSM-derived erosion thresholds into critical shear stress, a form that permits incorporation into sediment transport models.},

  abstract = {Cohesive sediment is an important component of aquatic environments, which must be monitored and managed for environmental, engineering, and human health reasons. While the hydrodynamic aspects of sediment erosion and transport are well understood, the erodibility of cohesive sediment has proved more difficult to address and predict. Erodibility is the propensity for the sediment to be eroded, and is represented typically as an erosion threshold or erosion rate. It is an attribute of the sediment itself, and is dependent on the sediment properties that dictate the resistive forces in the sediment, such as gravity, friction, cohesion, and adhesion. This paper reviews recent findings from a range of disciplines to create a comprehensive picture of the physical, geochemical and biological properties that influence the erodibility of cohesive sediment. By identifying these key sediment properties, we provide the background for a discussion on how changes in and interactions between the properties generate significant spatial and temporal variations in erodibility. We discuss the development of a predictive model of erodibility, and emphasize the need for more comparable field and laboratory data.},

The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date summary of the benefits and risks associated with using wood to promote geomorphological processes to restore and manage rivers. This summary was developed through a workshop that brought together academics, river managers, restoration practitioners and consultants in the UK to share science and best practice on wood in rivers. A consensus was developed on four key issues: (i) hydrogeomorphological effects, (ii) current use in restoration and management, (iii) uncertainties and risks and (iv) tools and guidance required to inform process-based restoration and management.},

  abstract = {AbstractMeasurements of morphologic change are often used to infer sediment mass balance. Such measurements may, however, result in gross errors when morphologic changes over short reaches are extrapolated to predict changes in sediment mass balance for long river segments. This issue is investigated by examination of morphologic change and sediment influx and efflux for a 100 km segment of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, Arizona. For each of four monitoring intervals within a 7 year study period, the direction of sand-storage response within short morphologic monitoring reaches was consistent with the flux-based sand mass balance. Both budgeting methods indicate that sand storage was stable or increased during the 7 year period. Extrapolation of the morphologic measurements outside the monitoring reaches does not, however, provide a reasonable estimate of the magnitude of sand-storage change for the 100 km study area. Extrapolation results in large errors, because there is large local variation in site behavior driven by interactions between the flow and local bed topography. During the same flow regime and reach-average sediment supply, some locations accumulate sand while others evacuate sand. The interaction of local hydraulics with local channel geometry exerts more control on local morphodynamic response than sand supply over an encompassing river segment. Changes in the upstream supply of sand modify bed responses but typically do not completely offset the effect of local hydraulics. Thus, accurate sediment budgets for long river segments inferred from reach-scale morphologic measurements must incorporate the effect of local hydraulics in a sampling design or avoid extrapolation altogether.},

  abstract = {Surrogate technologies to continuously monitor suspended sediment show promise toward supplanting traditional data collection methods requiring routine collection and analysis of water samples. Commercially available instruments operating on bulk optic (turbidity), laser optic, pressure difference, and acoustic backscatter principles are evaluated based on cost, reliability, robustness, accuracy, sample volume, susceptibility to biological fouling, and suitable range of mass concentration and particle size distribution. In situ turbidimeters are widely used. They provide reliable data where the point measurements can be reliably correlated to the river's mean cross section concentration value, effects of biological fouling can be minimized, and concentrations remain below the sensor's upper measurement limit. In situ laser diffraction instruments have similar limitations and can cost 6 times the approximate \$5000 purchase price of a turbidimeter. However, laser diffraction instruments provide volumetric-concentration data in 32 size classes. Pressure differential instruments measure mass density in a water column, thus integrating substantially more streamflow than a point measurement. They are designed for monitoring medium-to-large concentrations, are generally unaffected by biological fouling, and cost about the same as a turbidimeter. However, their performance has been marginal in field applications. Acoustic Doppler profilers use acoustic backscatter to measure suspended sediment concentrations in orders of magnitude more streamflow than do instruments that rely on point measurements. The technology is relatively robust and generally immune to effects of biological fouling. Cost of a single-frequency device is about double that of a turbidimeter. Multifrequency arrays also provide the potential to resolve concentrations by clay silt versus sand size fractions. Multifrequency hydroacoustics shows the most promise for revolutionizing collection of continuous suspended sediment data by instruments that require only periodic calibration for correlation to mean concentrations in river cross sections. Broad application of proven suspended sediment surrogate technologies has the potential to revolutionize fluvial sediment monitoring. Once applied, benefits could be enormous, providing for safer, more frequent and consistent, arguably more accurate, and ultimately less expensive sediment data for managing the world's sedimentary resources.},

  abstract = {The combination of the mountainous terrain of Albania and a seasonally wet Mediterranean climate has led to some of the most extreme erosion in Europe. New methodology is used in this work to estimate soil erosion risk and provide a framework for soil conservation that can effectively and economically control soil loss. A onedimensional hydrology, vegetation and erosion model (RDI/CSEP) is used to calculate accumulative soil erosion. This model provides an integrating the climatic, topography and associated vegetation components into soil erosion modeling. The forecast runoff, accumulated across the frequency distribution of storms, is used to give a climatic potential, which is then appropriately combined with measures of topography and soil erodibility to estimate the expected rate of soil erosion at a resolution of 1 km. Annual and monthly soil erosion maps of Albania are also developed in this research. The proposed approach for evolution and mapping soil erosion by water uses existing soil maps, land use maps, a digital elevation model (1km), and interpolated climate data. The erosion maps clearly show that Albania is a country where erosion is potentially severe. The annual erosion rates are estimated at 10 t ha{\textendash}1y{\textendash}1 or more, especially in the south and center part of the country. In three areas (two in Gjirokast{\"e}r, and one in Sarand{\"e}) the annual erosion rate is more than 100 t ha{\textendash}1 y{\textendash}1. Erosion rates are highest in October, November, February and December and lowest in June and July.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Several forms of the universal soil loss equation, along with the ANSWERS hydrologic/erosion model were used to estimate soil erosion on topographically non-uniform field and farm units on two farms in Indiana. Both soil loss at a point and average soil loss along a landscape profile were used to estimate erosion. Soil loss estimates using USLE methods were aggregated to obtain field and farm averages. ANSWERS was included because it computes erosion over topographically non-uniform areas. Sampling density was critical for the USLE methods, while element size was critical for ANSWERS. With sufficiently dense sampling, each USLE method gave similar results, but the method that estimated average erosion on the landscape profiles required the fewest sampling points. The ANSWERS and USLE results, although different, were comparable considering the differences in prediction techniques.},

  abstract = {Free-flowing rivers (FFRs) support diverse, complex and dynamic ecosystems globally, providing important societal and economic services. Infrastructure development threatens the ecosystem processes, biodiversity and services that these rivers support. Here we assess the connectivity status of 12 million kilometres of rivers globally and identify those that remain free-flowing in their entire length. Only 37 per cent of rivers longer than 1,000 kilometres remain free-flowing over their entire length and 23 per cent flow uninterrupted to the ocean. Very long FFRs are largely restricted to remote regions of the Arctic and of the Amazon and Congo basins. In densely populated areas only few very long rivers remain free-flowing, such as the Irrawaddy and Salween. Dams and reservoirs and their up- and downstream propagation of fragmentation and flow regulation are the leading contributors to the loss of river connectivity. By applying a new method to quantify riverine connectivity and map FFRs, we provide a foundation for concerted global and national strategies to maintain or restore them.},

To address this, we identify and quantify ``natural climate solutions'' (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS{\textemdash}when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation{\textemdash}is 23.8 petagrams of CO2 equivalent (PgCO2e) y-1 (95\% CI 20.3{\textendash}37.4). This is {$\geq$}30\% higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO2e y-1) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO2 pollution is {$\geq$}100 USD MgCO2e-1 by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37\% of cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed through 2030 for a {$>$}66\% chance of holding warming to below 2 {\textdegree}C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO2-1. Most NCS actions{\textemdash}if effectively implemented{\textemdash}also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides a robust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystem stewardship as a major solution to climate change.}

  abstract = {Snow is an important hydrological reservoir within the water cycle, particularly when the watershed includes a mountainous area. Modellers often overlook water stocked in snow pack and its influence on water distribution, especially when only some portions of the watershed is snow dominated. Snow is usually considered to improve hydrological modelling statistics, but without any regard for the realism of its representation or its influence on the hydrological cycle. This is all the more true when semi-distributed models are used, often considered inadequate for spatially representing such phenomena. On the other hand, semi-distributed models are being increasingly used to realise water budget assessment at a regional scale and such studies should not be realised without a good representation of the snow pack. Lack of field measurements is also a frequent justification for avoiding validating simulated snow packs. In this study, remote sensing data provided by MODIS is combined with in situ data, enabling the validation of the snow pack simulated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a semi-distributed, physically-based model, implemented over a partly snow-dominated watershed. Snow simulation was performed without complex algorithms or calibration procedures, using the elevation bands option included in the model and related snow parameters. Representation of snow cover and hydrological simulation were achieved by a standard automatic calibration of the model, over the 2000{\textendash}2010 period, performed by SWAT-Cup/SUFI2, using six hydrological gauging stations along the fluvial continuum downstream of the snow-dominated area. Results highlight three important points: (i) Set-up of elevation bands over mountainous headwater improved hydrological simulation performance, even well downstream of the snow-dominated area. (ii) SWAT produced a good spatial and temporal representation of the snow cover, using MODIS data, despite a slight overestimation at the end of the snow season on the highest elevation bands. A comparison of the model estimate of snowpack water content with in situ data revealed an underestimation in water content in the lower part of the watershed and a slight overestimation in its upper part. Those errors are linked and originate from difficulties of the model to incorporate very local spatial and temporal variations of the precipitation lapse rate. (iii) Elevation bands brought consistent changes in water distribution within the hydrological cycle of implemented watersheds, which are more in line with expected flow paths.},

We identified locations with upwelling and downwelling fluxes of HWE as well as ambiguous hydraulic contact between groundwater and surface water along the river. In these locations, we sampled bottom-dwelling macroinvertebrates. In total, 627 individuals of benthic macroinvertebrates of 34 taxa were identified. We revealed that bottom-dwelling macroinvertebrate fauna is more abundant and diverse in river stretches where water from the river infiltrates the hyporheic zone. Results also show higher taxonomic richness and abundances of benthic macroinvertebrates in stretches with diagnosed infiltrating conditions (downwelling flux in a hyporheic zone) compared to in stretches where the river drained groundwater (upwelling flux in a hyporheic zone), but the recorded differences were not statistically significant.},

  abstract = {Meander dynamics has been the focus of river engineering for decades; however, it remains a challenge for researchers to precisely replicate natural evolution processes of meandering channels with numerical models due to the high nonlinearity of the governing equations. The present study puts forward a nonlinear model to simulate the flow pattern and evolution of meandering channels. The proposed meander model adopts the nonlinear hydrodynamic submodel developed by Blanckaert and de Vriend, which accounts for the nonlinear interactions between secondary flow and main flow and therefore has no curvature restriction. With the computational flow field, the evolution process of the channel centerline is simulated using the Bank Erosion and Retreat Model (BERM) developed by Chen and Duan. Verification against two laboratory flume experiments indicates the proposed meander model yields satisfactory agreement with the measured data. For comparison, the same experimental cases are also simulated with the linear version of the hydrodynamic submodel. Calculated results show that the flow pattern and meander evolution process predicted by the nonlinear and the linear models are similar for mildly curved channels, whereas they exhibit different characteristics when channel sinuosity becomes relatively high. It is indicated that the nonlinear interactions between main flow and secondary flow prevent the growth of the secondary flow and induce a more uniform transverse velocity profile in high-sinuosity channels, which slows down the evolution process of meandering channels.},

In this study, samples of sediments (inorganic sands) with different particle sizes were inoculated with microorganisms and incubated for different time periods to examine sediment erosion and incipient motion of the sediment. Microbial activity created biofilm which adhered to particles on the upper layer and in the interstices of the sediment, so increasing the viscosity of the sediment and smoothing the sediment{\textendash}water interface. The critical shear stress consistently showed the same changes for all samples at different incubation periods: it increased rapidly in the early stage, reached a maximum in the middle stage, and decreased slightly in the late stage. This behavior was similar to the growth pattern of the biofilm. As the median diameter of sediment particles increased, the effect of microbial activity on sediment characteristics lessened. The effect of the biofilm was analyzed, and we modified the Shields number to evaluate the resistance to erosion and incipient motion conditions for the sediment after microbial activity. Analysis of the Shields curve for the biofilm-bound sediments showed that microbial activity significantly influences the resistance to erosion of the sediment when the Reynolds number (Re*) ranged from 0.2 to 50, but the influence is relatively small outside that range.},

Further, a series of scenarios with different setups of sediment-related parameters were tested to explore the possibility of a 2-D model to simulate morphological changes at a natural bend, and to investigate how much physical complexity is needed for reliable modeling. The results suggest that a 2-D depth-averaged model can reconstruct the hydrodynamic and morphological features at a bend reasonably provided that the model addresses a secondary flow correction, and reasonably parameterize grain-sizes within a channel in a pragmatic way. The factors, such as sediment transport formula and roughness height, have relatively less significance on the bed change pattern at a bend. The study reveals that the secondary flow effect and grain-size parameterization should be given a first priority among other parameters when modeling bed deformation at a natural bend using a 2-D model.},

This study employs a two-dimensional (2D) numerical model to track the hydromorphological processes dominated by fine suspended sediment, including the prediction of sediment concentration in flow bodies, and erosion and deposition caused by sediment transport. The model is governed by 2D full shallow water equations with which an advection{\textendash}diffusion equation for fine sediment is coupled. Bed erosion and sedimentation are updated by a bed deformation model based on local sediment entrainment and settling flux in flow bodies. The model is initially validated with the three laboratory-scale experimental events where suspended load plays a dominant role. Satisfactory simulation results confirm the model's capability in capturing hydro-morphodynamic processes dominated by fine suspended sediment at laboratory-scale. Applications to sedimentation in a stormwater pond are conducted to develop the process-based understanding of fine sediment dynamics over a variety of flow conditions. Urban flows with 5-year, 30-year and 100-year return period and the extreme flood event in 2012 are simulated. The modelled results deliver a step change in understanding fine sediment dynamics in stormwater ponds. The model is capable of quantitatively simulating and qualitatively assessing the performance of a stormwater pond in managing urban water quantity and quality.},

However, the response of sediment discharge to the coupled influence of anthropogenic and natural factors and the associated impacts on the fluvial geomorphology in the Yangtze and Mekong rivers are not comprehensively assessed. Here, we recalibrated a seamless retrieval algorithm of the total suspended sediment (TSS) concentrations using in situ data and concurrent satellite data sets to analyze spatiotemporal patterns of the TSS concentrations in the lower Yangtze and Mekong rivers. Combined with soil erosion rates estimated by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation for the past 20 years, we examined the contributions of different factors to TSS trends. The results show that TSS concentrations in the Yangtze River decreased from 0.47 g L-1 in 2000 to 0.23 g L-1 in 2018 due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), especially in the Jingjiang reach, with a declining magnitude of 0.3 g L-1 ({$\sim$}56\%) since the TGD began operating. The Mekong River experienced increasing TSS concentration trends upstream and decreasing trends downstream from 2000 to 2018, possibly attributed to increased upstream soil erosion and decreased downstream water discharge. Declining TSS concentrations in both rivers have driven varying degrees of river channel erosion over the past two decades. This study investigated long-term changes in the TSS concentrations and soil erosion in the Yangtze and Mekong rivers, and the results provide baseline information for the sustainable development of river sediment delivery.},

Calibration of the MIKE21C numerical model by the Danish Hydraulic Institute at the 25-km-long reach of Lower Paran{\`a} near Rosario (Argentina) is presented. This reach includes two downstream confluences and two bifurcations. The model simulates a 2-D depth-averaged flow velocity and the related sediment fluxes to predict the bifurcation morphodynamics that affects the Paran{\`a} waterway. To investigate the river channel bathymetry, roughness, flow discharge allocation at bifurcations, suspended sediment concentration and grain size distributions, several instruments were used. These instruments included two ADCPs by Teledyne RDI working at frequencies of 600 and 1,200 kHz, a Sontek ADCP working at a frequency of 1,000 kHz and a SBES. The method to assess suspended sediment concentration and grain size distributions has been previously described. This paper focuses primarily on investigating dune morphology (by means of SBES depth measurements) and friction velocity (by means of ADCP profiling) to determine the river channel bed-roughness. The 2-D model results agree with observed values of bed-roughness, flow velocity and suspended sediment concentration distributions at the investigated sections, known data of water slope and total load of bed sediment are in good agreement with model results.},

  abstract = {Hydrologic and geomorphic classifications have gained traction in response to the increasing need for basin-wide water resources management. Regardless of the selected classification scheme, an open scientific challenge is how to extend information from limited field sites to classify tens of thousands to millions of channel reaches across a basin. To address this spatial scaling challenge, this study leverages machine learning to predict reach-scale geomorphic channel types using publicly available geospatial data. A bottom-up machine learning approach selects the most accurate and stable model among 20,000 combinations of 287 coarse geospatial predictors, preprocessing methods, and algorithms in a three-tiered framework to (i) define a tractable problem and reduce predictor noise, (ii) assess model performance in statistical learning, and (iii) assess model performance in prediction. This study also addresses key issues related to the design, interpretation, and diagnosis of machine learning models in hydrologic sciences. In an application to the Sacramento River basin (California, USA), the developed framework selects a Random Forest model to predict 10 channel types previously determined from 290 field surveys over 108,943 two hundred-meter reaches. Performance in statistical learning is reasonable with a 61\% median cross-validation accuracy, a sixfold increase over the 10\% accuracy of the baseline random model, and the predictions coherently capture the large-scale geomorphic organization of the landscape. Interestingly, in the study area, the persistent roughness of the topography partially controls channel types and the variation in the entropy-based predictive performance is explained by imperfect training information and scale mismatch between labels and predictors.},

In an effort to place this issue in the broad context of this rapidly changing and advancing research field, we begin by discussing the motivation behind this issue. Then, we continue by summarizing the main novel research contributions of each paper. Finally, we conclude by proposing five major research directions that directly develop from the ensemble of the scientific contributions to this special issue. These research directions emphasize the critical importance of the coupling of near-bank geomorphic and flow processes; the characterization of co-evolution of meandering rivers and their floodplains; the need to improve linkages between meandering rivers research and river management and restoration; the potential of expanding laboratory-based research; and the integration of holistic and reductionist approaches.},

  abstract = {Vegetation structure is an important biodiversity indicator providing biological and physical environment that supports and maintains forest biodiversity. The airborne lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) systems have the advantage of directly measuring three-dimensional vegetation structure, and have been widely used in wildlife habitat mapping and species distribution modeling at the local scales. As lidar data are increasingly compiled into broad spatial coverage, the development of structural inventory and indicators to categorize habitat types and identify important patches would be beneficial to regional-level conservation planning and biodiversity monitoring. However, this area of research has not been adequately explored. Large-area mapping of critical habitat patches is also a fundamental step towards modeling habitat connectivity. Quantification and dynamic modeling of habitat connectivity under long-term influence of land cover change events provide insights into forest management and conservation planning, and including climate change constraints into the modeling framework also helps maintain ecosystem integrity and improve conservation effectiveness. Therefore, the objectives of this thesis are to 1) characterize vegetation structure and identify important habitat patches with critical structural traits using regional lidar dataset, and 2) build habitat networks to model connectivity dynamics under land cover change events. To do this, first, a novel approach using cluster analysis to process large-area lidar data into categorical classes representing natural groupings of habitat structure was applied to derive eight unique structure classes in the managed forested area in Alberta, Canada. Second, the structure classes indicating high levels of structure complexity combined with Landsat-derived forest cover types were used to identify important habitat patches to develop habitat networks. Lastly, spatial prioritization schemes based on different aspects of connectivity and climate constraints were generated and implemented through scenario-based simulations of land cover change events. Connectivity dynamics through the simulations were assessed and compared between scenarios. The result showed that the conservation strategies considering both habitat area and habitat spatial configuration were best at maintaining habitat connectivity, and taking climate constraints into consideration didn't affect overall connectivity. Overall, this research provides an integrated approach to characterize habitat structure using large-area lidar data for dynamic connectivity modeling following land cover change simulations.},

Therefore, the calibration procedure must be conducted carefully to maximize the reliability of the model. In general, manual procedures for calibration can be extremely time-consuming and frustrating, and this has been a major factor inhibiting the widespread use of the more sophisticated and complex hydrologic models. A global optimization algorithm entitled shuffled complex evolution recently was developed that has proved to be consistent, effective, and efficient in locating the globally optimal model parameters of a hydrologic model. In this paper, the capability of the shuffled complex evolution automatic procedure is compared with the interactive multilevel calibration multistage semiautomated method developed for calibration of the Sacramento soil moisture accounting streamflow forecasting model of the U.S. National Weather Service. The results suggest that the state of the art in automatic calibration now can be expected to perform with a level of skill approaching that of a welltrained hydrologist. This enables the hydrologist to take advantage of the power of automated methods to obtain good parameter estimates that are consistent with the historical data and to then use personal judgment to refine these estimates and account for other factors and knowledge not incorporated easily into the automated procedure. The analysis also suggests that simple split-sample testing of model performance is not capable of reliably indicating the existence of model divergence and that more robust performance evaluation criteria are needed.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces this special issue of Aquatic Sciences. It outlines a multi-scale, hierarchical framework for developing process-based understanding of catchment to reach hydromorphology that can aid design and delivery of sustainable river management solutions. The framework was developed within the REFORM (REstoring rivers FOR effective catchment Management) project, funded by the European Union's FP7 Programme. Specific aspects of this `REFORM framework' and some applications are presented in other papers in this special issue. The REFORM framework is founded on previous hierarchical frameworks, sixteen examples of which are reviewed. However, the REFORM framework has some particular properties that reflect the European context for which it was developed. The framework delineates regional landscapes into nested spatial units at catchment, landscape unit, segment, reach, geomorphic unit and finer scales. Reaches, regardless of their `naturalness', are assigned to a river type based on valley confinement, planform and bed material. Indicators are quantified at each spatial scale to feed three groups of assessments. First, contemporary indicators at reach and geomorphic unit scales investigate present processes, forms and human pressures within each reach. These feed assessments of present reach hydromorphological function/alteration, including whether the reach is functioning appropriately for its type; riparian corridor function and alteration; and hydromorphological adjustment. Second, indicators at catchment to segment scales investigate water and sediment production and delivery to reaches and how these are affected by human pressures now and in the past. These are used to construct an inventory of changes over space and time. Third, historical reach and geomorphic unit scale indicators are used to construct the trajectory of reach-scale changes. Contemporary reach-scale assessments, space{\textendash}time inventory, and trajectory of changes are then combined to establish how river reaches of different type, subject to different human pressures, and located in different environmental contexts behave in response to changes at all considered spatial scales. These support forecasts of the likely responses of reaches to future scenarios (e.g., changes in climate, land cover, channel interventions).},

  abstract = {The geomorphological dynamics of rivers have been traditionally explained largely by the physical processes of water flow, and sediment erosion and deposition, but the significant role of a third element, vegetation, in driving geomorphological changes has been increasingly highlighted recently. However, few studies have documented how both aquatic and woody riparian plants interact with fluvial processes to induce landform development and initiate channel adjustment. This paper presents analyses of historical maps, recent aerial images and field observations from the River Frome (Dorset, UK), which, as a result of human pressures, has been subject to an increased supply of sand and finer sediment, particularly over the last 50{\textendash}60 years. Analysis of these information sources indicates that this low-energy river has adjusted to this delivery of finer sediment by narrowing and increasing its sinuosity. The analysis also indicates that this has been achieved through interactions amongst vegetation, water flow and sediment. Emergent aquatic macrophytes were observed to retain sediment, which leads to the development of submerged shelves that aggrade and become colonized by other plant species to form bars, berms and benches, eventually leading to the extension of river banks into the channel and also the formation of islands. Where woody riparian vegetation is well developed, complex geomorphic changes were observed, with fine sediment being absorbed into a diverse mosaic of geomorphic features initiated by living trees and large wood. These observations underline the importance of vegetation for the geomorphic dynamics and adjustment of lowland, low-energy rivers and its potential for inclusion in the development of sustainable, process-based river management and restoration strategies.

  abstract = {The role of aquatic and riparian vegetation in driving morphodynamics of rivers is being increasingly recognized across all river types. Here, we focus on gravel-bed rivers, where the ability of vegetation to influence morphodynamics depends upon the retention and stabilization of predominantly sand and finer sediments to build landforms within the active channel. One aspect of such interactions among vegetation, river flows and transported sediments that has received little research attention is their contribution to within-channel storage of fine sediment as a potentially important component of the fine sediment budget of river reaches and catchments. In this article, we assemble some preliminary estimates of the fine sediments retained by vegetation across the active channels of four gravel-bed rivers (12 river reaches) representing a wide range in river planform (near-straight, meandering, braided), width (6{\textendash}800 m), gradient (0.0008{\textendash}0.004) and Q2 flood (2{\textendash}1100 m3 s-1), and including reaches where submerged and emergent macrophytes and riparian trees and shrubs act as physical ecosystem engineers. Our results indicate that vegetation can retain sizeable quantities of fine sediment, ranging from 480 to {$>$}3000 kg m-2 in emergent vegetation-engineered landforms, equivalent to 20{\textendash}1000 kg m-2 when averaged across the entire active channel area. Vegetation retains virtually all the fine sediments stored on the bed surface of these active channels, increasing from 78\% in the lowest energy to 100\% in the highest energy river reaches investigated, with major differences in the locations of these vegetated fine sediment stores according to river planform style and unit stream power. These preliminary estimates suggest that fine sediment retention and storage by vegetation is potentially an important component of within-channel sediment budgets as well as contributing to the hydrological, geomorphological and ecological functioning of rivers.},

We construct two large infinite pseudo-random families of samples of both types satisfying INAH: in case (i) for any k{$\geq$}3 and in case (ii) for some larger k. Furthermore, case (ii) ANOVA, being restricted to the pair of groups (i,j), may reject equality {$\mu$}i={$\mu$}j with the same {$\alpha$}. This is an obvious contradiction, since {$\mu$}1={\dots}={$\mu$}k implies {$\mu$}i={$\mu$}j for all i,j{$\in$}\{1,{\dots},k\}. Such contradictions appear already in the symmetric case for k=3, or in other words, for three groups of d,d, and c observations with sample means +1,-1, and 0, respectively. We outline conditions necessary and sufficient for this phenomenon. Similar contradictory examples are constructed for the multivariable linear regression (MLR). However, for these constructions, it seems difficult to verify the Gauss{\textendash}Markov assumptions, which are standardly required for MLR. Mathematics Subject Classification: 62 Statistics.},

  abstract = {Rewetted peatlands can be a significant source of methane (CH4), but in coastal ecosystems, input of sulfate-rich seawater could potentially mitigate these emissions. The presence of sulfate as an electron acceptor during organic matter decomposition is known to suppress methanogenesis by favoring the growth of sulfate reducers, which outcompete methanogens for substrate. We investigated the effects of a brackish water inflow on the microbial communities relative to CH4 production{\textendash}consumption dynamics in a freshwater rewetted fen at the southern Baltic Sea coast after a storm surge in January 2019 and analyzed our data in context with the previous freshwater rewetted state (2014 serves as our baseline) and the conditions after a severe drought in 2018 (Fig. 1).  We took peat cores at four previously sampled locations along a brackishness gradient to compare soil and pore water geochemistry as well as the microbial methane- and sulfate-cycling communities with the previous conditions. We used high-throughput sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to characterize pools of DNA and RNA targeting total and putatively active bacteria and archaea. Furthermore, we measured CH4 fluxes along the gradient and determined the concentrations and isotopic signatures of trace gases in the peat.  We found that both the inflow effect of brackish water and the preceding drought increased the sulfate availability in the surface and pore water. Nevertheless, peat soil CH4 concentrations and the 13C compositions of CH4 and total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) indicated ongoing methanogenesis and little methane oxidation. Accordingly, we did not observe a decrease in absolute methanogenic archaea abundance or a substantial change in methanogenic community composition following the inflow but found that the methanogenic community had mainly changed during the preceding drought. In contrast, absolute abundances of aerobic methanotrophic bacteria decreased back to their pre-drought level after the inflow, while they had increased during the drought year. In line with the higher sulfate concentrations, the absolute abundances of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) increased {\textendash} as expected {\textendash} by almost 3 orders of magnitude compared to the freshwater state and also exceeded abundances recorded during the drought by over 2 orders of magnitude. Against our expectations, methanotrophic archaea (ANME), capable of sulfate-mediated anaerobic methane oxidation, did not increase in abundance after the brackish water inflow. Altogether, we could find no microbial evidence for hampered methane production or increased methane consumption in the peat soil after the brackish water inflow. Because Koebsch et al. (2020) reported a new minimum in CH4 fluxes at this site since rewetting of the site in 2009, methane oxidation may, however, take place in the water column above the peat soil or in the loose organic litter on the ground. This highlights the importance of considering all compartments across the peat{\textendash}water{\textendash}atmosphere continuum to develop an in-depth understanding of inflow events in rewetted peatlands. We propose that the changes in microbial communities and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes relative to the previous freshwater rewetting state cannot be explained with the brackish water inflow alone but were potentially reinforced by a biogeochemical legacy effect of the preceding drought.},

We begin by describing phenomena such as bed load and suspension transport from a classical perspective by applying the mean wall shear stress approach while additionally incorporating a statistical description of the inherent wall shear stress fluctuations. Concepts from turbulent flow regime are introduced to address the limitations of the classical approach to various aspects of sediment transport, such as for example, the Newtonian description of dense suspensions, or the description of the self-organization processes for developing bed forms, or the prediction of transport in very rough bed conditions. In this context coherent structures and flow separation mechanisms are developed as important new elements, which allow using topological rules for the formulation of transport especially for developing bed forms. Since the most up-to-date research findings in the field are presented, this book serves as both a support in the formulation of academic research programs, and as a practical text.},

Since river morphology is a result of two major boundary conditions {\textemdash} transport of water and sediments {\textemdash} the size of project areas and the analysis procedure were found to be critical. Restricting the assessment of abiotic and biotic river components and its variability to a certain scale neglects the fact that ecological integrity depends on the process scale of boundary conditions. A newly developed two-step procedure for assessing the ecological integrity at various temporal and spatial scales is presented. During the so-called downscaling phase, abiotic and biotic components are analysed at the regional-continental (only for special questions), catchment-wide, sectional, local, and point scales. Catchment-wide analyses are based on digital elevation models (DEMs) and geographic information systems (GISs). Mass balance analysis, the application of fractals, and self-similarity studies for channel developments gain increasing importance. The application of linear and non-linear theories allows analytical tools to be derived to describe abiotic components like morphodynamics at sectional and local scales. Point scale investigations are based on deterministic models, where input data can be measured directly in nature. As the scale varies dramatically, the results obtained from various analysis tools are significantly different but interdependent. Biotic analysis are also performed at the same scales, so that the interrelations between morphodynamics and habitat quality can be derived at the end of this first phase. In a second phase an upscaling integrates and aggregates the results from the first step in order to yield overall conclusions on ecological integrity.},

The transport experiment showed that transport distance has a close relation to flow depth and also implied that the magnitude and sequence of a series of flows were important factors for S-CWD transport and retention in streams. The survey of CWD distribution indicated that in-stream obstructions played an important role in the S-CWD retention in deeper channels where S-CWD pieces were potentially transported distances more than spacing between trapping sites of CWD. Overall, the in situ field experiment and the segment- to reach-scaled analysis using h* (=depth/diameter) helped us understand the actual movement and distribution of CWD.},

Most obviously, ecosystems can provide us with material things that are essential for our daily lives, such as food, wood, wool and medicines. Although the other types of benefit we get from ecosystems are easily overlooked, they also play an important role in regulating the environments in which we live. They can help ensure the flow of clean water and protect us from flooding or other hazards like soil erosion, land-slips and tsunamis. They can contribute to our spiritual well-being, through their cultural or religious significance or the opportunities they provide for recreation and the enjoyment of nature.In this chapter, we will look at the goods and services that ecosystems can provide and the role that biodiversity may play in producing them, specifically the contribution that biodiversity makes to people's livelihoods, to their security and to their health. In other words, we will concentrate mainly on the utilitarian value of biodiversity. We will also explore how these ideas link up with those of the Ecosystem Approach to environmental management and policy, and some of the implications of this for how sustainable development is defined.},

  abstract = {Modeling is an invaluable tool for studying sedimentary basin filling and for understanding depositional processes with long recurrence intervals, including channel avulsion. Simplified modeling approaches, such as cellular models and process-analogue experiments, are particularly useful for efficiently exploring alternative hypotheses and evaluating first-order controls on river avulsion and alluvial architecture. Here we review the history and current state of the art in simplified avulsion and alluvial architecture models, with a particular focus on how results and insights from these models can be incorporated into field and subsurface studies, and vice versa. Simplified avulsion and alluvial architecture models have proliferated in the past decade, providing a wide variety of models to serve as a basis for future coupled field-modeling studies. We compare features of leading models and discuss avenues for effectively pairing model capabilities with hypotheses and field data. Outstanding questions highlighted by recent modeling efforts include 1) What thresholds control avulsion initiation in different systems? 2) How do floodplain processes and topography influence avulsion dynamics and alluvial architecture? 3) What factors determine where avulsion channels stabilize? Answering these questions will require targeted modeling efforts coupled to data from ancient systems. Hence our model comparison emphasizes features that can be used to choose or design fit-for-purpose models, and we outline how quantitative data useful for model selection and validation can be obtained from modern systems and ancient deposits. Matching model goals with targeted questions, and model parameters and predictions with quantitative field data, will help tighten communication between field- and model-oriented sedimentary geologists, facilitating advances in our understanding of river avulsion and alluvial architecture.},

In this paper the inverse problem of sensitivity analysis is tackled, in order to diagnose the influence that model input variables, together and in combination, have on the uncertainty in the inundation model prediction. Variance-based global sensitivity analysis is applied to simulation of a flood on a reach of the River Thames (United Kingdom) for which a synthetic aperture radar image of the extent of flooding was available for model validation. The sensitivity analysis using the method of Sobol' quantifies the significant influence of variance in the Manning channel roughness coefficient in raster-based flood inundation model predictions of flood outline and flood depth. The spatial influence of the Manning channel roughness coefficient is analyzed by dividing the channel into subreaches and calculating variance-based sensitivity indices for each subreach. Replicated Latin hypercube sampling is used for sensitivity analysis with correlated input variables. The methodology identifies subreaches of channel that have the most influence on variance in the model predictions, demonstrating how far boundary effects propagate into the model and indicating where further data acquisition and nested higherresolution model studies should be targeted.},

  abstract = {Bayesian theory of model calibration provides a coherent framework for distinguishing and encoding multiple sources of uncertainty in probabilistic predictions of flooding. This paper demonstrates the use of a Bayesian approach to computer model calibration, where the calibration data are in the form of spatial observations of flood extent. The Bayesian procedure involves generating posterior distributions of the flood model calibration parameters and observation error, as well as a Gaussian model inadequacy function, which represents the discrepancy between the best model predictions and reality. The approach is first illustrated with a simple didactic example and is then applied to a flood model of a reach of the river Thames in the UK. A predictive spatial distribution of flooding is generated for a flood of given severity.},

  abstract = {We summarize the results of flume experiments examining the transport behavior of dilute suspensions of silt-sized particles carried in an open channel flow over three separate bed types including porous open mesh, glass beads, and small cobbles. In these experiments the time-varying concentration of particles in suspension transport was measured as a function of suspended-particle size and bed shear stress, and analyzed using a 1-D model incorporating simultaneous deposition and entrainment. Rates of fine-particle deposition to the bed are found to approach Stoke's settling velocity in slow flows, but diminish systematically with increasing bed shear stress and mean flow speed. No discernible re-entrainment from the porous beds was observed, indicating that such beds act as an effective sink for fine particles. When our new results are compared to those of related, previously reported experiments examining fine-particle transport over smooth impermeable beds, silt-sized particles display similar behavior with regard to systematic reduction in deposition velocity independent of suspended-silt-particle size or bed porosity. This behavior is tentatively interpreted to reflect the effects of lift in a linear shear flow in excess of submerged weight of individual particles. Our findings compare favorably with values of effective settling velocity of fine particulate organic matter in natural channel flows reported elsewhere.},

  abstract = {We evaluate three approaches to mapping vegetation using images collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to monitor rehabilitation activities in the Five Islands Nature Reserve, Wollongong (Australia). Between April 2017 and July 2018, four aerial surveys of Big Island were undertaken to map changes to island vegetation following helicopter herbicide sprays to eradicate weeds, including the creeper Coastal Morning Glory (Ipomoea cairica) and Kikuyu Grass (Cenchrus clandestinus). The spraying was followed by a large scale planting campaign to introduce native plants, such as tussocks of Spiny-headed Mat-rush (Lomandra longifolia). Three approaches to mapping vegetation were evaluated, including: (i) a pixel-based image classification algorithm applied to the composite spectral wavebands of the images collected, (ii) manual digitisation of vegetation directly from images based on visual interpretation, and (iii) the application of a machine learning algorithm, LeNet, based on a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting planted Lomandra tussocks. The uncertainty of each approach was assessed via comparison against an independently collected field dataset. Each of the vegetation mapping approaches had a comparable accuracy; for a selected weed management and planting area, the overall accuracies were 82 \%, 91 \% and 85 \% respectively for the pixel based image classification, the visual interpretation / digitisation and the CNN machine learning algorithm. At the scale of the whole island, statistically significant differences in the performance of the three approaches to mapping Lomandra plants were detected via ANOVA. The manual digitisation took a longer time to perform than others. The three approaches resulted in markedly different vegetation maps characterised by different digital data formats, which offered fundamentally different types of information on vegetation character. We draw attention to the need to consider how different digital map products will be used for vegetation management (e.g. monitoring the health individual species or a broader profile of the community). Where individual plants are to be monitored over time, a feature-based approach that represents plants as vector points is appropriate. The CNN approach emerged as a promising technique in this regard as it leveraged spatial information from the UAV images within the architecture of the learning framework by enforcing a local connectivity pattern between neurons of adjacent layers to incorporate the spatial relationships between features that comprised the shape of the Lomandra tussocks detected.},

Disturbances such as secondary flows and flow separation caused by the bend may persist for considerable distances in the downstream channel. A simple way of reducing these disturbances is through the insertion of vertical vanes in the bend section. A laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) unit was used to measure the three-dimensional mean and turbulent velocity components of flow in an experimental rectangular open-channel bend. Flow characteristics of the bend with no vanes are compared with those of bends having one or three vertical vanes. The size of the flow separation zone at the inner wall of the bend was determined from dye visualization data and confirmed with mean streamwise velocity data. Results show that the vertical vanes are effective in considerably reducing flow separation, intensity of secondary flows, and turbulence energy in the downstream channel. Furthermore, energy loss for bends with vanes is slightly less than for the no-vane case. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774 .0000337. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

The modeling region of the Tenryu River is divided into 48 river stations with 47 reaches in the numerical simulations. The numerical model is calibrated using the available data for 48~years from 1957 to 2004. The formulae of sediment transport function, Manning's roughness coefficient, computational increment and fall velocity have been identified for getting the best estimation of the Sakuma Dam reservoir sedimentation. Combination of obtained sensitive parameters and erodible limits of 2~m gave the best comparison with the measured bed profile. The computed results follow the trend of measured data with a small underestimation. Although Manning's roughness coefficient has an effect on the sedimentation, no direct relation is found between the Manning's roughness coefficient and reservoir sedimentation. It is found that the temperature of water has no effect on the reservoir sedimentation.},

The olfactory and gustatory systems comprise the major chemosensory pathways. Despite considerable variations in structural organization of the peripheral olfactory organ throughout fish species, ultrastructural organization of the olfactory sensory epithelium is extremely consistent. The olfactory receptor cell is a bipolar neurone which is directly exposed to the external environment and sends information to the brain by its own axon (cranial nerve I). Four major classes of chemicals have been identified as specific olfactory stimuli and their stimulatory effectiveness characterized: amino acids, sex steroids, bile acids/salts and prostaglandins. Olfactory signals such as those involved in reproduction and feeding may be processed independently through two distinct subsystems: the lateral and medial olfactory systems. The taste buds constitute the structural basis of the gustatory organ. Taste buds may occur not only in the oropharyngeal cavity, but on the whole body surface. Chemical information detected by specialized epithelial cells, gustatory cells, is transmitted to the central nervous system by cranial nerve VII (facial), IX (glossopharyngeal), and X (vagal). Besides diverse sensitivities and specificities for amino acids, fish gustatory receptors detect various organic acids, nucleotides and bile salts. Putative receptors, molecular mechanisms of transduction and the role played by olfaction and gustation in feeding, reproduction, migration and other fish behaviours are discussed.},

The snow-covered area (SCA) is often estimated by using optical satellite information in combination with the normalized-difference snow index (NDSI). The NDSI thereby uses a threshold for the definition if a satellite pixel is assumed to be snow covered or snow free. The spatiotemporal representativeness of the standard threshold of 0.4 is however questionable at the local scale. Here, we use local snow cover maps derived from ground-based photography to continuously calibrate the NDSI threshold values (NDSI\textsubscript{thr}) of Landsat satellite images at two European mountain sites of the period from 2010 to 2015. The Research Catchment Zugspitzplatt (RCZ, Germany) and Vernagtferner area (VF, Austria) are both located within a single Landsat scene. Nevertheless, the long-term analysis of the NDSI\textsubscript{thr} demonstrated that the NDSI\textsubscript{thr} at these sites are not correlated (\emph{r}\&thinsp;=\&thinsp;0.17) and different than the standard threshold of 0.4. For further comparison, a dynamic and locally optimized NDSI threshold was used as well as another locally optimized literature threshold value (0.7). It was shown that large uncertainties in the prediction of the SCA of up to 24.1\&thinsp;\% exist in satellite snow cover maps in cases where the standard threshold of 0.4 is used, but a newly developed calibrated quadratic polynomial model which accounts for seasonal threshold dynamics can reduce this error. The model minimizes the SCA uncertainties at the calibration site VF by 50\&thinsp;\% in the evaluation period and was also able to improve the results at RCZ in a significant way. Additionally, a scaling experiment shows that the positive effect of a locally adapted threshold diminishes using a pixel size of 500\&thinsp;m or larger, underlining the general applicability of the standard threshold at larger scales.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Machine learning (ML) together with remote sensing has emerged as a powerful and promising combination to quantify water quality parameters from space. However, inland water sample data for DOC is limited. Hence, little is known about the potential to quantify DOC content in inland waters, especially over large-scale areas. This study presents the first attempt to estimate DOC in inland waters over a large-scale area using satellite data and ML methods with the newly published open-source dataset AquaSat. Four ML approaches, namely Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and a Multilayer Backpropagation Neural Network (MBPNN) were trained using more than 16 thousand samples across the continental United States matched with satellite data from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 missions. Satellite data from the Landsat missions were further extended with environmental data from the ERA5-Land product and used as input to train the ML algorithms. Our results show that including environmental data as inputs considerably improved the prediction of DOC for all ML algorithms, with GPR showing the most promising performance results with moderate estimation errors (RMSE: 4.08 mg/L). Permutation feature importance analysis showed that the wavelength range in the visible Green band (from Landsat) and the monthly average air temperature (from ERA5-Land) were the most important variables for the ML approaches. The results demonstrate the predictive strength of GPR and its useful feature to derive per pixel standard deviations for detailed analysis. Our results further highlight the important role of considering environmental processes to explain DOC variations over large scales. The application and performance of the GPR in mapping spatiotemporal variations of DOC in an entire water body were discussed by taking Lake Okeechobee (the 8th largest freshwater lake in the U.S.) as an illustrative example. While performance evaluation showed that DOC concentrations can be retrieved with adequate accuracy, algorithm development was challenged by the heterogenous nature of large-scale open source in situ data, issues related to atmospheric correction, and the low spatial and temporal resolution of the environmental predictors. This research demonstrates how open source, large-scale datasets like AquaSat in combination with ML and satellite remote sensing can make research toward large-scale estimation of inland water DOC more realistic while highlighting its remaining limitations and challenges.},

  abstract = {Fine sediment storage within gravel beds is a key component of catchment sediment budgets and affects the health of benthic and hyporheic habitats. Here, we assess the performance of two substrate infiltration traps for the characterization of fine sediment ({$<$}2 mm) accumulation. One design, the vertically extending sediment trap, permits both lateral and vertical exchange in the sediment column, whereas the second type, a more traditional fixed-area sediment trap with impermeable side walls, permits only vertical exchange. Traps were deployed at three sites on the River Tame, Birmingham (UK), over varying installation periods (14{\textendash}401 days). Results indicate that the facilitation of multiple pathways of exchange within the vertically extending sediment traps (vertical and lateral) resulted in a significantly greater amount of fine sediment being accumulated than in adjacent fixed-area sediment traps. This suggests that lateral transport is an important component contributing to fine sediment accumulation. However, there are notable and inherent problems associated with the use of different types of sediment trap and in the way the data should be presented and interpreted. This paper discusses the practical implications of the study findings and reflects on the complexities of undertaking accurate sediment deposition measurements in the field.},

  abstract = {Large-scale river restoration programs have emerged recently as a tool for improving spawning habitat for native salmonids in highly altered river ecosystems. Few studies have quantified the extent to which restored habitat is utilized by salmonids, which habitat features influence redd site selection, or the persistence of restored habitat over time. We investigated fall-run Chinook salmon spawning site utilization and measured and modeled corresponding habitat characteristics in two restored reaches: a reach of channel and floodplain enhancement completed in 2013 and a reconfigured channel and floodplain constructed in 2002. Redd surveys demonstrated that both restoration projects supported a high density of salmon redds, 3 and 14 years following restoration. Salmon redds were constructed in coarse gravel substrates located in areas of high sediment mobility, as determined by measurements of gravel friction angles and a grain entrainment model. Salmon redds were located near transitions between pool-riffle bedforms in regions of high predicted hyporheic flows. Habitat quality (quantified as a function of stream hydraulics) and hyporheic flow were both strong predictors of redd occurrence, though the relative roles of these variables differed between sites. Our findings indicate that physical controls on redd site selection in restored channels were similar to those reported for natural channels elsewhere. Our results further highlight that in addition to traditional habitat criteria (e.g., water depth, velocity, and substrate size), quantifying sediment texture and mobility, as well as intragravel flow, provides a more complete understanding of the ecological benefits provided by river restoration projects.},

  abstract = {A numerical hydrological simulation suggested that water exchange between stream channels and adjacent aquifers is enhanced by convexities and concavities in streambed topography. At St. Kevin Gulch, an effluent stream in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, subsurface hydraulic gradients and movement of ionic tracers indicated that stream water was locally recharged into well-defined flow paths through the alluvium. Stream water-filled flow paths in the alluvium (referred to as substream flow paths) returned to the stream a short distance downstream (1 to 10 m). Recharge to the substream flow paths occurred where stream water slope increased, at the transition from pools ({$<$}1\%) to steeper channel units (5{\textendash}20\%). Return of substream flow paths to the stream occurred where stream water slope decreased, at the transition from steeper channel units to pools. A net water flux calculation is typically used to characterize water and solute fluxes between surface and subsurface zones of catchments. Along our study reach at St. Kevin Gulch the net inflow of water from subsurface to stream (1.6 mL s-1 m-1) underestimated the gross inflow (2.7 mL s-1 m-1) by 40\%. The influence of streambed topography is to enhance hydrological fluxes between stream water and subsurface zones and to prolong water-sediment contact times; these effects could have important consequences for solute transport, retention, and transformation in catchments.},

In order to define the best estimated hydraulic conductivity and boundary condition for Gareh-Bygone Plain in arid southern Iran, ten different steady-state conditions were simulated and calibrated with limited field observations. The investigated area covers about 6000 ha with a floodwater spreading system that was established on about 2000 ha to artificially recharge the groundwater. The results showed a consistency over the 14-year simulation period with estimated hydraulic conductivity in a quite narrow range. This makes us believe that even if the modeling problem is to some extent over-parameterized the results appear quite robust. This is further strengthened by verification of the model results. Furthermore, the results showed that in the steady-state groundwater flow with no recharge from surface water, the system is mainly recharged by the fault which conducts water into the area from an upper sub-basin.},

However, adapting these codes to new functionality or introducing greater flexibility often requires significant recoding.

We implement recent algorithmic advances that reduce the computational cost of flow routing {\dbend}{\dbend}a problem that typically scales quadratically with the number of unknowns {\dbend}{\dbend}to linear in time while allowing for parallel implementations of geomorphic transport processes.

Bed elevations and surface imagery at high spatial resolutions were used to quantify the co-evolution of surface grain-size distribution (GSD), bed roughness statistics, and bed surface structures (clusters, cells and transverse features). Using a new semi-automated method, we identified individual stone structures over a 2 m {\texttimes} 1 m area throughout the experiments. After an initial coarsening, surface GSD and armouring ratio remained nearly stable as sediment pulses caused net bed aggradation. In contrast, individual grain structures continued to form, increase or decrease in size, and disappear throughout the experiments. The response of the bed to sediment pulses depended on the history of surface roughness evolution and bed surface structure development, as these factors changed much more in response to supply perturbations earlier in the experiments compared to later, even as the bed continued to aggrade. We interpret that the dynamic production and destruction of bed surface structures can act as a `buffer' to sediment supply pulses, maintaining a stable bed surface during aggradation with minimal change in grain size or armouring. {\textcopyright} 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The Future Danube Model (FDM) is an end-user driven multi-hazard and risk model suite for the Danube region that has been developed to provide climate services related to perils such as heavy precipitation, heat waves, floods, and droughts under recent and scenario conditions. As a result, it provides spatially consistent information on extreme events and natural resources throughout the entire Danube catchment. It can be used to quantify climate risks, to support the implementation of the EU framework directives, for climate informed urban and land use planning, water resources management, and for climate proofing of large scale infrastructural planning including cost benefit analysis. The model suite consists of five individual and exchangeable modules: a weather and climate module, a hydrological module, a risk module, an adaptation module, and a web-based visualization module. They are linked in such a way that output from one module can either be used standalone or fed into subsequent modules. The utility of the tool has been tested by experts and stakeholders. The results show that more and more intense hydrological extremes are likely to occur under climate scenario conditions, e.g. higher order floods may occur more frequently.},

  abstract = {Rates of biological invasion have increased over recent centuries and are expected to increase in the future. Whereas increasing rates of non-native species incursions across realms, taxonomic groups, and regions are well-reported, trends in abundances within these contexts have lacked analysis due to a paucity of long-term data at large spatiotemporal scales. These knowledge gaps impede prioritisation of realms, regions, and taxonomic groups for management. We analysed 180 biological time series (median 15~{$\pm~$}12.8 sampling years) mainly from Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites comprising abundances of marine, freshwater, and terrestrial non-native species in Europe. A high number (150; 83,3~\%) of these time series were invaded by at least one non-native species. We tested whether (i) local long-term abundance trends of non-native species are consistent among environmental realms, taxonomic groups, and regions, and (ii) if any detected trend can be explained by climatic conditions. Our results indicate that abundance trends at local scales are highly variable, with evidence of declines in marine and freshwater long-term monitoring sites, despite non-native species reports increasing rapidly since the late 1970s. These declines were driven mostly by abundance trends in non-native fish, birds, and invertebrate species in three biogeographic regions (Continental, Atlantic, and the North Sea). Temperature and precipitation were important predictors of observed abundance trends across Europe. Yet, the response was larger for species with already declining trends and differed among taxa. Our results indicate that trends in biological invasions, especially across different taxonomic groups, are context-dependent and require robust local data to understand long-term trends across contexts at large scales. While the process of biological invasion is spatiotemporally broad, economic or ecological impacts are generally realised on the local level. Accordingly, we urge proactive and coordinated management actions from local to large scales, as invasion impacts are substantial and dynamics are prone to change.},

  abstract = {A new conceptual mesohabitat evaluation model was developed and applied to the Kamp River, Austria. The model uses a functional linkage of three parameters (velocity, depth and bottom shear stress) to distinguish six different mesohabitat types (riffle, fast run, run, pool, backwater and shallow water) based on two-dimensional depth-averaged hydrodynamic-numerical modelling. The results clearly revealed the variety and change of mesohabitat-units under various flow conditions (3.6{\textendash}89 m3s-1). In particular for low-energy habitats, a shift from shallow- to backwater habitats was recognized at increasing discharges. Fast runs featured a larger percentage of the total wetted area (9{\textendash}33\%) as discharges increased, whereas pool habitats showed low variability (means of around 15\%). A velocity-depth-bottom shear stress relationship (VDSR) was most suitable to differentiate between mesohabitat patterns; this relationship was compared with Froude numbers and with velocity-depth ratios using ANOVA statistical analysis. This study also documented that the accuracy of river geometry plays a decisive role in habitat descriptions. Different height tolerances for the computation mesh (0.2 m, 0.5 m, 1 m accuracy) based on LiDAR significantly reduced important mesohabitats.

  abstract = {This paper investigates the variability of mesohabitat characteristics in various riffle-pool reaches. The tested river sections (n = 13) feature clear variation in slope (0.0004{\textendash}0.0132) and low flow discharge (0.05{\textendash}915 m3s-1) in different river types (straight to meandering). Mesohabitat characteristics (water depth, flow velocity, bottom shear stress) were calibrated according to the MEM-concept (MEM{\textemdash}Mesohabitat Evaluation Model). Statistical analysis clearly revealed significant differences (p {$<$} 0.001) for the same mesohabitats (e.g. riffles) in different rivers concerning the tested abiotic habitat parameters. A comparative analysis of hydromorphological parameters (width-depth variance, Froude number) showed no correlation to mesohabitat variability based on 2D/3D numerical modelling related to a range of flows (n = 10) (low flow to annual flood). Only an increasing hydraulic radius (Rhy) was correlated to an increase in fast run and a decrease in run habitats. In a case study, a Fish Guild Concept (FGC) is presented which links mesohabitats to the rheophilic fish guild (12 fish species grouped) at the Sulm River. Mesohabitat suitability (preferred, useable and avoided) for the FGC was determined for spawning, juveniles (0+, 1+), sub-adult and adult stages based on meso-unit and point abundance electro-fishing.

  abstract = {It is predicted that 60\% of all new energy investments over the next 20 years will be in renewables. The estimation for new hydropower production is 25\% of all new renewables primarily due to potential in China, Africa, Latin America and South-East Asia. Also in Europe a growth of hydropower production is aimed to achieve emission targets within the European Union by 2050. However, one of the main economic, technical and ecological challenges in future are the deposition, the treatment, and the disturbed dynamics of sediments in river catchments, which reduce the future market potential of hydropower substantially. Due to a lack in awareness of those sedimentological challenges (e.g. lack of process understanding), various huge economical, technical and ecological problems emerge with an increasing relevance for hydropower industry, water management authorities and the society in future. Based on a substantial literature review, (i) legal frameworks and (ii) reservoir management techniques including (iii) process understanding and numerical modelling are addressed in this article. Moreover, the relevant cost-effective aspects of abrasion are worked out for (iv) turbine runners and (v) sediment bypass systems as well as the (vi) the ecological relevance of sediments and possible disturbances are described in this manuscript to open a future discussion on technical opportunities. It was concluded, that all these issues should be addressed within the framework of the overall aim to minimize the costs under consideration of ecological requirements and standards by an improved sediment management in terms of hydropower use. Moreover, it was stated that trans- and interdisciplinary research is required, to achieve those aims in future.},

  abstract = {Summary The three-dimensional numerical model SSIIM was used to compute suspended sediment distribution and deposition pattern in a hydropower reservoir. The study also included three-dimensional measurements of suspended sediments in the reservoir using the LISST-SL instrument. The measurement device is based on a laser-diffraction method and measures concentrations and grain size distributions instantly. It was applied to 25 locations in the reservoir where vertical profiles were taken. The measurements and computed results were compared and reasonable agreement was found. In addition, computed bed elevation changes were compared with measured values in the conducted study. The results of the numerical model agree well with the bed levels taken by echo sounding. The numerical model SSIIM solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations in three dimensions and uses an adaptive grid which moves in accordance to changes in the water and bed levels. The suspended sediment transport is calculated by solving the convection{\textendash}diffusion equation and the bed load transport by an empirical formula. The used implicit free-water surface algorithm provides the possibility of using large time step sizes, which makes a simulation of an operation year on a desktop PC possible.},

  abstract = {Hydro-morphology describes the interactions between water and sediments in fluvial systems and the corresponding processes across all spatial and temporal scales. The results are natural and anthropogenically influenced bed structures and fluvial landforms. However, many of these hydro-morphological processes cannot be described analytically yet, as a result of their stochastic behaviour and the multitude of processes involved across spatial and temporal scales. Deeper knowledge of these processes is essential, not only for understanding the system itself, but also for practical applications, which rely on correct and reliable investigations of these processes. During the European Geoscience Union (EGU) General Assembly (GA) 2018 in Vienna, Austria, the conveners of the session on ``Measurements, monitoring and numerical modelling of sedimentary and hydro-morphological processes in open-water environments'' had the idea of initiating a special issue, containing a collection of recent achievements in this research field. The aim of this extended introduction is twofold. First, an overview on research needs in investigating hydro-morphological processes in open-water environments is given in this article. Second, recently published studies that aim to improve the understanding of hydro-morphological processes in rivers, lakes and reservoirs by innovative measurement approaches are discussed. In addition to submitted papers collected from the EGU GA in 2017, 2018 and 2019, related studies published in Earth Surface Processes and Landforms (ESPL) over the last two years are also incorporated into this special issue. The papers selected cover a wide range of studies with differing spatial and temporal resolutions. This broad spectrum of different scales clearly indicates the challenges associated with the development and use of advanced methods for investigating hydro-morphological processes in open-water environments.},

  abstract = {We propose a hierarchical system of classifying stream habitats based on three increasingly fine descriptions of the morphological and hydraulic properties of channel geomorphic units. We define channel geomorphic units as areas of relatively homogeneous depth and flow that are bounded by sharp gradients in both depth and flow. Differences among these units provide a natural basis for habitat classification that is independent of spatial scale. At the most general level of resolution, we divide channel units into fast- and slow-water categories that approximately correspond to the commonly used terms ``riffle'' and ``pool.'' Within the fast-water category, we identify two subcategories of habitats, those that are highly turbulent (falls, cascades, chutes, rapids and riffles) and those with low turbulence (sheets and runs). Slow-water habitats include pools formed by channel scour (eddy pools, trench pools, mid-channel pools, convergence pools, lateral scour pools and plunge pools) and those formed behind dams. Dammed pools include those obstructed by debris dams, beaver dams, landslides and abandoned channels. We consider back-waters as a type of dammed pool. Fishes and other stream organisms distinguish among these habitats at one or more levels of hierarchy. Habitats defined in this way represent an important habitat templet on which patterns of biological diversity and production form. We believe that a hierarchical system of classification will facilitate understanding of biotic-habitat relationships in streams and lead to more effective methods of evaluating the effects of environmental change on stream ecosystems. Refining the criteria by which habitats are distinguished, quantifying how different species use different habitats, and integrating the ways biota respond to habitat variation should facilitate the emergence of a theory of stream habitat organization.},

However, the shift of primary flow by secondary currents is not quantitatively understood, due to the difficulty in isolating the role of curvature-driven secondary flow from that of topography-driven secondary flow in bed-deformed meanders. The influences of curvaturedriven and topography-driven secondary currents on the redistribution of primary flow in sine-generated meandering channels were examined by CCHE2D. The model is calibrated using data measured in two sets of laboratory experiments including flat-bed flow and mobile-bed flow. Analysis indicated that topography-induced current mainly contributes to the redistribution of primary flow from inner to outer bank in the curved channels, rather than the secondary flow driven by curvature.},

An accurate and stable weight loss was achieved after 2 h of burning pure CaCO3 at 950 {\textdegree}C, whereas LOI of pure graphite at 530 {\textdegree}C showed a direct relation to sample size and exposure time, with only 40-70\% of the possible weight loss reached after 2 h of exposure and smaller samples losing weight faster than larger ones. Experiments with a standardised lake sediment revealed a strong initial weight loss at 550 {\textdegree}C, but samples continued to lose weight at a slow rate at exposure of up to 64 h, which was likely the effect of loss of volatile salts, structural water of clay minerals or metal oxides, or of inorganic carbon after the initial burning of organic matter. A further test-run revealed that at 550 {\textdegree}C samples in the centre of the furnace lost more weight than marginal samples. At 950 {\textdegree}C this pattern was still apparent but the differences became negligible. Again, LOI was dependent on sample size.},

  abstract = {Stable soil organic matter (SOM) is important for long-term sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC), but the usefulness of different fractionation methods to isolate stable SOM is open to question. We assessed the suitability of five chemical fractionation methods (stepwise hydrolysis, treatment with H2O2, Na2S2O8, NaOCl, and demineralization of the NaOCl-resistant fraction (NaOCl {\th} HF)) to isolate stable SOM from soil samples of a loamy sand and a silty loam under different land use regimes (grassland, forest and arable crops). The apparent C turnover time and mean age of SOC before and after fractionation was determined by 13C and 14C analysis. Particulate organic matter was removed by density fractionation before soils were exposed to chemical fractionation. All chemical treatments induced large SOC losses of 62{\textendash}95\% of the mineral-associated SOC fraction. The amounts of H2O2and Na2S2O8-resistant SOC were independent from land use, while those of NaOCl- (NaOCl {\th} HF)and hydrolysis-resistant SOC were not. All chemical treatments caused a preferential removal of young, maize-derived SOC, with Na2S2O8 and H2O2 being most efficient. The mean 14C age of SOC was 1000{\textendash}10000 years greater after chemical fractionation than that of the initial, mineral-associated SOC and mean 14C ages increased in the order: NaOCl {$<$} NaOCl {\th} HF stepwise hydrolysis ( H2O2 \% Na2S2O8. None of the methods appeared generally suitable for the determination of the inert organic matter pool of the Rothamsted Carbon Model. Nonetheless, our results indicate that all methods are able to isolate an older, more stable SOC fraction, but treatments with H2O2 and Na2S2O8 were the most efficient ones in isolating stable SOM.},

  abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms have gained increasing interest for dealing with continuous optimization problems in recent years. Often such problems involve boundary constraints. In this case, one has to cope with the situation that particles may leave the feasible search space. To deal with such situations different bound handling methods have been proposed in the literature and it has been observed that the success of PSO algorithms depends on a large degree on the used bound handling method. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to cope with bounded search spaces. The idea is to introduce a velocity adaptation mechanism into PSO algorithms that is similar to step size adaptation used in evolution strategies. Using this approach we show that the bound handling method becomes less important for PSO algorithms and that using velocity adaptation leads to better results for a wide range of benchmark functions.},

  abstract = {Microplastics have been predominantly studied in marine environments compared to freshwater systems. However, the number of studies analyzing microplastic concentrations in water and sediment within lakes and rivers are increasing and are of utmost importance as freshwaters are major pathways for plastics to the oceans. To allow for an adequate risk assessment, detailed knowledge concerning plastic concentrations in different environmental compartments of freshwaters are necessary. Therefore, the major aim of this study was the quantification and analysis of temporal and spatial distribution of microplastics ({$<$}5 mm) in freshwater shore and bed sediments at Lake Tollense, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. Likewise, it addresses the hy\- pothesis that lakes may serve as long-term storage basins for microplastics. Concentrations were investigated semi-annually over a two-year period at four sandy bank border segments representing different expositions and levels of anthropogenic influence. In addition, lakebed samples were taken along the longitudinal dimension of Lake Tollense. Mean microplastic abundances were 1,410 {$\pm$} 822 particles/kg DW for lakeshore sediments and 10,476 {$\pm$} 4,290 particles/kg DW for lakebed sediments. Fragments were more abundant compared to fibers in both sediment compartments. Spatial and temporal variation was especially recognized for lakeshore sediments whereas microplastic abundances in lakebed sediments did not differ significantly between sampling points and sampling campaigns. This can be related to long-term accumulation at the lakebed. Lower microplastic abun\- dances were found within the intertidal zone at lake beaches where constant wave action reduces accumulation. Increased microplastic abundances were recognized at the beach with least anthropogenic influence but in proximity to a tributary, which may serve as microplastic input pathway into Lake Tollense due to its catchment comprising mainly agricultural areas. Furthermore, spatial variations in microplastic concentrations were related to the abundance of macroplastic items at beaches and correlated with pedologic sediment characteristics, namely the content of organic matter.},

A restoration experiment was carried out in a former channel of the Rh{\^o}ne River according to a scientifically based decision framework. Long-term monitoring of aquatic vegetation (17 years of data) on two former channels (reference and restored ecosystem) clearly demonstrated human impacts on aquatic ecosystems. A channel exhibiting rapid terrestrialization and eutrophication processes after completion of a hydroelectric scheme construction was restored. In keeping with the hypothesis, the increase in groundwater supply led the restored ecosystem to return to a less advanced and self-sustainable successional stage, whereas vegetation monitoring in the reference channel did not show significant changes over this 17-year of period, supporting long-term studies to determine the effects of restoration on the biota.},

Periphytic diatoms, macrophytes, benthic macroinvertebrates and fish were sampled with standard methods in 185 streams in nine European countries to compare their response to degradation. Streams were classified into two main stream type groups (i.e. lowland, mountain streams); in addition, the lowland streams were grouped into four more specific stream types. 2. Principal components analysis with altogether 43 environmental parameters was used to construct complex stressor gradients for physical{\textendash}chemical, hydromorphological and land use data. About 30 metrics were calculated for each sample and organism group. Metric responses to different stress types were analysed by Spearman Rank Correlation. 3. All four organism groups showed significant response to eutrophication/organic pollution gradients. Generally, diatom metrics were most strongly correlated to eutrophication gradients (85\% and 89\% of the diatom metrics tested correlated significantly in mountain and lowland streams, respectively), followed by invertebrate metrics (91\% and 59\%). 4. Responses of the four organism groups to other gradients were less strong; all organism groups responded to varying degrees to land use changes, hydromorphological degradation on the microhabitat scale and general degradation gradients, while the response to hydromorphological gradients on the reach scale was mainly limited to benthic macroinvertebrates (50\% and 44\% of the metrics tested correlated significantly in mountain and lowland streams, respectively) and fish (29\% and 47\%). 5. Fish and macrophyte metrics generally showed a poor response to degradation gradients in mountain streams and a strong response in lowland streams. 6. General recommendations on European bioassessment of streams were derived from the results.},

  abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

  abstract = {A new class of advection schemes combining the best properties of implicit finite element and explicit finite volume schemes is presented, along with very large time steps, as there is no CFL condition, even with tidal flats, which was the main goal. The hydroinformatic system Telemac is based on unstructured grids, it includes a Shallow Water Equations solver (Telemac-2D), a Navier-Stokes solver in 3 dimensions with a free surface (Telemac-3D), and a morphodynamics model for suspension and bed load (Sisyphe). Dealing with dry zones is now common practice but hinders a lot classical advection schemes. We present here a new class of advection schemes combining the best properties of implicit finite element and explicit finite volume schemes. The resulting capabilities of the method are: mass-conservation (water and tracers), be it in 2D or 3D, monotonicity (depth and tracers), along with very large time steps, as there is no CFL condition, even with tidal flats, which was the main goal. The technique works in parallel and can also be used to gain flexibility in building highly distorted 3D meshes between bottom and free surface. It can also be used to solve the Exner equation for bed load transport. Test cases are presented.},

  abstract = {The hyporheic zone is often defined as where mixing of surface water and groundwater occurs in shallow sediments beneath and adjacent to rivers. This mixing is credited with creating unique biogeochemical conditions that can attenuate contaminants from either upstream surface water or groundwater under gaining conditions. However, reactions of contaminants upwelling from groundwater may be more dependent on such mixing than contaminants from surface water. We numerically modeled mixing between hyporheic flow paths induced by riverbed dunes and flow paths of adjacent upwelling of deeper groundwater. Results show that only 12.7\% or less tracer mass upwelling from deeper groundwater dispersed across into hyporheic flow paths originating in surface water. The spatial extent of a mixing-defined hyporheic zone was smaller than a hyporheic zone defined as hydrologic flow paths leaving and returning to surface water. Mixing-dependent reactions will therefore be localized within a thin mixing zone yet vary considerably with site conditions. For example, mixing in homogeneous sediments was controlled most by variation in hydraulic conductivity and upwelling flow rate which primarily affected mixing zone length. By contrast, introduction of heterogeneity increased mixing primarily by increasing mixing zone thickness, consistent with studies of flow focusing in aquifers. Finally, dispersivity is a critical parameter for which data are needed for shallow sediments. Our results help clarify hyporheic zone definitions and potential for mixing-dependent reactions. In particular, the biogeochemically reactive portion of riverbed sediments from the perspective of upwelling contaminants does not necessarily spatially coincide with more traditional hydrologic conceptions of the hyporheic zone.},

The current paper provides a test where detailed field measurements of velocities and bed elevation changes over a 3-month period from a prototype reservoir are compared with simulation results. The SSIIM software was used to compute water flow and sediment transport in the Iffezheim reservoir. The numerical model solved the Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations on a 3D unstructured grid with dominantly hexahedral cells. The k-epsilon turbulence model was used, together with the SIMPLE method to find the pressure. The 3D convection{\textendash}diffusion equation for suspended sediments was solved for nine sediment fractions. The computed velocity pattern showed good correspondence with the measurements. Grid sensitivity tests showed that the main flow features were computed in different grid sizes, but more accurately so with the finest grid. The sediment deposits were reasonably well computed in location and magnitude. A sensitivity test revealed that the computed bed elevation changes were most sensitive to the fall velocities of the finest cohesive sediment particles and sediment cohesion. The sediment deposition computations were also to some degree sensitive to the sediment discharge formula, bed roughness, discretization scheme and the grid resolution.}

  abstract = {This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of sediment and dissolved load across an entire mountain range. We investigate patterns and rates of modern denudation of the European Alps based on a compilation of data about river loads and reservoir sedimentation from 202 drainage basins that are between ca. 1 to 10,000 km2 large. The study basins cover about 50\% of the total area of the Alps. Modern glaciated basins have the highest sediment yields of up to 7000 t km-2 a-1, which are on average 5 to 10 times higher than in non-glaciated basins. Likewise sediment yield and glacial cover are positively correlated. Instead, relief is a relatively weak predictor of sediment yield. The strong glacial impact in the correlations is due to glacier recession since the 19th century as well as due to glacial conditioning during repeated Quaternary glaciations which have produced the strong transient state of the Alpine landscape. We suggest that this is the major cause for ca. 3 fold enhanced denudation of the western compared to the eastern Alps. Chemical denudation rates are highest in the external Alps dominated by carbonate sedimentary rocks, where they make up about one third of total denudation. The high rates cannot be explained without anhydrite dissolution. We estimated that only 45\% of the sediments mobilized in headwaters are exported out off the Alps, most sediments being trapped in artificial reservoirs. The total amount of sediment annually trapped within the Alps equates to 43 Mt. When corrected for sediment storage, we obtain an area-weighted mean total denudation rate for the Alps of about 0.32 mm a-1. The pre-dam rate might be as high as 0.42 mm a-1. In total, ca. 35 plus 23 Mt of mass are exported each year out of the Alps as solids and solutes, respectively. These rates are not enough to out pace modern rock uplift. Nevertheless, pattern of sediment yield across the Alps coincides roughly with the intensity of glacial conditioning and modern rock uplift, supporting the hypothesis of an erosion-driven uplift of the Alps.},

The primary goal of stream restoration is typically to restore habitat or maintain balance between natural ecosystem function and human land use. Although many benefits result from stream restoration, the carbon sequestration potential of different restoration approaches in diverse geographic settings has not yet been quantified. We investigate the carbon storage potential of restored stream segments (known as treatment segments) relative to otherwise analogous degraded and reference segments. We develop a conceptual framework to identify the conditions that maximize carbon storage in relation to characteristics of the river corridor and specific restoration practices and propose response surfaces for carbon storage. We illustrate application and quantification of the conceptual framework using data from a pilot study of treatment, degraded, and reference stream segments along two streams in Oregon, United States. The conceptual model is designed to help managers identify levels of hydrologic connectivity, channel and floodplain dynamics, floodplain vegetation, and other variables that may optimize carbon storage at a treatment site.}

These models, estimated using sample values of concentration, discharge, and date, are used to compute estimated fluxes for a multiyear period at a daily time step. This study compares results of the LOADEST seven-parameter model, LOADEST five-parameter model, and the Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) model using subsampling of six very large datasets to better understand this bias problem. This analysis considers sample datasets for dissolved nitrate and total phosphorus. The results show that LOADEST-7 and LOADEST-5, although they often produce very nearly unbiased results, can produce highly biased results. This study identifies three conditions that can give rise to these severe biases: (1) lack of fit of the log of concentration vs. log discharge relationship, (2) substantial differences in the shape of this relationship across seasons, and (3) severely heteroscedastic residuals. The WRTDS model is more resistant to the bias problem than the LOADEST models but is not immune to them. Understanding the causes of the bias problem is crucial to selecting an appropriate method for flux computations. Diagnostic tools for identifying the potential for bias problems are introduced, and strategies for resolving bias problems are described.},

  abstract = {Climate change impacts on sediment production and transfer processes on hillslopes and through channels are governed by possible changes in precipitation, runoff, and air temperature. These hydrological and geomorphological impacts are difficult to predict in temperature-sensitive Alpine environments. In this study, we combined a stochastic weather generator model with the most current climate change projections to feed a hillslope-channel sediment cascade model for a major debris-flow system in the Swiss Alps (the Illgraben). This allowed us to quantify climate change impacts and their uncertainties on sediment yield and the number of debris flows at hourly temporal resolution. We show that projected changes in precipitation and air temperature lead to a reduction in both sediment yield (-48\%) and debris-flow occurrence (-23\%). This change is caused by a decrease in sediment supply from hillslopes, which is driven by frost-weathering. Additionally, we conduct model experiments that show the sensitivity of projected changes in sediment yield and debris-flow hazard to basin elevation, with important implications for assessing natural hazards and risks in mountain environments. Future changes in hydrological and sediment fluxes are characterized by high uncertainty, mainly due to irreducible internal climate variability. Therefore, this stochastic uncertainty needs to be considered in climate change impact assessments for geomorphic systems.},

  abstract = {Temperature index or degree-day models rest upon a claimed relationship between snow or ice melt and air temperature usually expressed in the form of positive temperatures. Since air temperature generally is the most readily available data, such models have been the most widely used method of ice and snow melt computations for many purposes, such as hydrological modelling, ice dynamic modelling or climate sensitivity studies. Despite their simplicity, temperature-index models have proven to be powerful tools for melt modelling, often on a catchment scale outperforming energy balance models. However, two shortcomings are evident: (1) although working well over long time periods their accuracy decreases with increasing temporal resolution; (2) spatial variability cannot be modelled accurately as melt rates may vary substantially due to topographic effects such as shading, slope and aspect angles. These effects are particularly crucial in mountain areas. This paper provides an overview of temperature-index methods, including glacier environments, and discusses recent advances on distributed approaches attempting to account for topographic effects in complex terrain, while retaining scarcity of data input. In the light of an increasing demand for melt estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution, such approaches need further refinement and development.},

Here, we present data on the erodibility of cohesive sediments from the impounded Upper Rhine River and develop a modelling concept to understand the suspended sediment dynamics along the impounded Upper Rhine. The conceptual framework includes 10 reservoirs of the Upper Rhine between Basel and Iffezheim, which serve as long-term sinks of cohesive sediment. Each reservoir is represented by a 1D sediment budget model, which is coupled to its upstream and downstream neighbour. In this paper, we focus on the uncertainty associated with the measurement of the erodibility of cohesive sediments and on the implications to model the risk of erosion. The statistical analysis showed a large uncertainty of the estimated critical shear stresses and erosion rates. Root mean square errors are in the order of 50\% and 100\% of the average critical shear stresses and average erosion rates, respectively. Preliminary model results are in good agreement with bed changes of the Iffezheim reservoir, which were measured using approximately quarterly echo-soundings of the reservoir. The probabilistic approach that is based on Monte-Carlo simulations allows assessing the uncertainty related to our limited knowledge (i) of the dynamics of contaminated sediments and (ii) of the environmental conditions in the reservoir that control the risk of erosion of contaminated sediments.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Anthropogenic land-use and land cover change (LULCC) is a major driver of environmental changes. The biophysical impacts of these changes on the regional climate in Europe are currently extensively investigated within the WCRP CORDEX Flagship Pilot Study (FPS) LUCAS {\textendash} "Land Use and Climate Across Scales" using an ensemble of different Regional Climate Models (RCMs) coupled with diverse Land Surface Models (LSMs). In order to investigate the impact of realistic LULCC on past and future climates, high-resolution datasets with observed LULCC and projected future LULCC scenarios are required as input for the RCM-LSM simulations. To account for these needs, we generated the LUCAS LUC Version 1.0 at 0.1{\textdegree} resolution for Europe Hoffmann et al. (2021b,c). The plant functional type distribution for the year 2015 (i.e. LANDMATE PFT dataset) is derived from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (ESA-CCI LC) dataset. Details about the conversion method based on a cross-walking procedure and the evaluation of the LANDMATE PFT dataset are given in the companion paper by Reinhart et al. (submitted). Subsequently, we applied the land-use change information from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) dataset, provided at 0.25{\textdegree} resolution as input for CMIP6 experiments, to derive realistic LULC distribution at high spatial resolution and at annual timesteps from 1950 to 2100. In order to convert land use and land management change information from LUH2 into changes in the PFT distribution, we developed a Land Use Translator (LUT) specific to the needs of RCMs. The annual PFT maps for Europe for the period 1950 to 2015 are derived from the historical LUH2 dataset by applying the LUT backward from 2015 to 1950. Historical changes in the forest type changes are considered using an additional European forest species dataset. The historical changes in the PFT distribution of LUCAS LUC follow closely the land use changes given by LUH2 but differ in some regions compared to remotely-sensed PFT time series. From 2016 onward, annual PFT maps for future land use change scenarios based on LUH2 are derived for different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) combinations used in the framework of the Coupled Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The resulting LULCC maps can be applied as land use forcing to the next generation of RCM simulations for downscaling of CMIP6 results. The newly developed LUT is transferable to other CORDEX regions world-wide.},

  abstract = {Operational flood forecasting models vary in complexity, but nearly all have parameters for which values must be estimated. The traditional and widespread manual calibration approach requires considerable training and experience and is typically laborious and time consuming. Under the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction System modernization program, National Weather Service (NWS) hydrologists must produce rapid calibrations for roughly 4000 forecast points throughout the United States. The classical single-objective automatic calibration approach, although fast and objective, has not received widespread acceptance among operational hydrologists. In the work reported here, University of Arizona researchers and NWS personnel have collaborated to combine the strengths of the manual and automatic calibration strategies. The result is a multistep automatic calibration scheme (MACS) that emulates the progression of steps followed by NWS hydrologists during manual calibration and rapidly provides acceptable parameter estimates. The MACS approach was tested on six operational basins (drainage areas from 671 to 1302 km2) in the North Central River Forecast Center (NCRFC) area. The results were found to compare favorably with the NCRFC manual calibrations in terms of both visual inspection and statistical measures, such as daily root-mean-square error and percent bias by flow group. Further, implementation of the MACS procedure requires only about 3{\textendash}4 person hours per basin, in contrast to the 15{\textendash}20 person hours typically required using the manual approach. Based on this study, the NCRFC has opted to perform further testing of the MACS procedure at a large number of forecast points that constitute the Grand River (Michigan) forecast group. MACS is a time-saving, reliable approach that can provide calibrations that are of comparable quality to the NCRFC's current methods.},

Measurements were carried out on the Elbow River at Bragg Creek, Alberta, during the summer flood periods of 1967, 1968, and 1969. Suspended load was measured directly by sampling. Bed-load was measured directly by sampling. Bed-load was measured by two types of sampler, herein designated the VUV (Hungarian type) and Basket type, respectively, and the results were compared to those obtained by measuring volumetrically the refilling rate of a large pit excavated in the river bed. This paper presents sediment-discharge rating curves and compares popular bed-load formulas, derived from flume measurements, to a natural gravel-bed river. A practical method is proposed for estimating bed-material discharge, utilizing field observations in conjunction with graphical correlations recently developed from an extensive analysis of flume data.},

  abstract = {The global land system is facing unprecedented pressures from growing human populations and climatic change. Understanding the effects these pressures may have is necessary to designing land management strategies that ensure food security, ecosystem service provision and successful climate mitigation and adaptation. However, the number of complex, interacting effects involved makes any complete understanding very difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, the recent development of integrated modelling frameworks allows for the exploration of the co-development of human and natural systems under scenarios of global change, potentially illuminating the main drivers and processes in future land system change. Here, we use one such integrated modelling framework (the CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment Platform) to investigate the range of projected outcomes in the European land system across climatic and socio-economic scenarios for the 2050s. We find substantial consistency in locations and types of change even under the most divergent conditions, with results suggesting that climate change alone will lead to a contraction in the agricultural and forest area within Europe, particularly in southern Europe. This is partly offset by the introduction of socioeconomic changes that change both the demand for agricultural production, through changing food demand and net imports, and the efficiency of agricultural production. Simulated extensification and abandonment in the Mediterranean region is driven by future decreases in the relative profitability of the agricultural sector in southern Europe, owing to decreased productivity as a consequence of increased heat and drought stress and reduced irrigation water availability. The very low likelihood ({$<$}33\% probability) that current land use proportions in many parts of Europe will remain unchanged suggests that future policy should seek to promote and support the multifunctional role of agriculture and forests in different European regions, rather than focusing on increased productivity as a route to agricultural and forestry viability.},

The two major issues are: 1) over sampling of sand transport caused by ``mining'' of sand due to the flow disturbance induced by the presence of the sampler and 2) clogging of the mesh bag with sand particles reducing the hydraulic efficiency of the sampler. Indirect measurement methods hold promise in that unlike direct methods, no transport-altering flow disturbance near the bed occurs. The bedform velocimetry method utilizes a measure of the bedform geometry and the speed of bedform translation to estimate the bedload transport through mass balance. The bedform velocimetry method is readily applied for the estimation of bedload transport in large sand-bed rivers so long as prominent bedforms are present and the streamflow discharge is steady for long enough to...},

Fluorescence is a non-destructive and in situ alternative, recently applied to microphytobenthos, using the minimum fluorescence signal (Fo) as a measurement of Chl a. In this study, Fo after 15 min of dark adaptation (Fo(15)) showed a significant positive correlation with Chl a (r = 0.84, p {$<$} 0.001, n = 24). The relationship between Fo(15) and Chl a extracted from sediment samples of increasing sample depth (0.2-2 min) became less significant as sediment depth increased. The strongest relationship between Fo(15) and Chl a, expressed as concentration (mg m(-2)) and content (mg kg(-1)), was found when all data were combined, but nearly comparable levels of association were found for in situ measurements using sediment cores up to 2.0 min deep. Results Suggested that full dark adaptation was not always achieved because a significant negative correlation was observed between Fv/Fm and ambient irradiance for seasonal data. In addition, Fo(15) showed a more significant correlation with Chl a than with Fm-15, suggesting some residual level of non-photochemical quenching after 15 min in the dark. Despite the incomplete dark adaptation, the highly significant relationships between Fo(15) and both Chl a concentration and content Suggest that the use of Fo(15) is a suitable in situ proxy method of estimating algal biomass.},

A large number of factors may influence its accuracy, such as furnace type, sample mass, duration and temperature of ignition and clay content of samples. We conducted a series of experiments to quantify these effects, which enabled us to derive (i) guidelines for ignition conditions (sample mass, duration and temperature), (ii) temperature-specific soil organic matter (SOM) to soil organic carbon (SOC) conversion factors and (iii) clay content-dependent correction factors for structural water loss (SWL). Bulk samples of a sandy soil (4\% clay) and a silt loam soil (25\% clay) were used to evaluate the effects of ignition conditions. Samples with a range of clay contents (0{\textendash}50\%) were used to quantify conversion and correction factors. Two furnaces, one without and one with pre-heated air, did not show significant differences in terms of within-batch LOI variability. In both furnaces less combustion occurred close to the door, which necessitated tray turning at half-time as this reduced the standard deviation per batch significantly. Variation in mass loss declined exponentially with sample mass (range, 0.15{\textendash}20 g). The LOI increased with duration at lower temperatures ({$\leq$} 550{$\circ$}C) for the sandy soil. At greater temperatures (600 and 650{$\circ$}C), no effect of duration was found. For the silt loam soil, LOI values increased with duration for each temperature, which was attributed to SWL. The SOM to SOC conversion factor decreased strongly with temperature at an ignition duration of 3 hours from 0.70 (350{$\circ$}C) to 0.57 (500{$\circ$}C) and stabilized around 0.55 between 550 and 650{$\circ$}C, indicating that at temperatures {$\geq$} 550{$\circ$}C all SOM had been removed. The clay correction factor for SWL increased from 0.01 to 0.09 as the temperature of ignition increased from 350 to 650{$\circ$}C. To minimize within-batch LOI variation we recommend a standard ignition duration of 3 hours, tray turning at half-time, a sample mass {$\geq$} 20 g and temperatures equal to or greater than 550 {$\circ$}C. To avoid over-estimates of SOM through structural water loss, the presented SWL correction procedure should always be applied.},

Bed shear stresses, bed geometry, the distribution of sediment in transport, and the strength of secondary flow were determined at each discharge. The zones of maximum bed shear stress, T, and maximum sediment discharge per unit width, qs', coincide. They are on the point bar in the upstream part of the bend, cross the channel centerline in the middle or downstream part of the bend, and follow the concave or down-valley bank to the next point bar downstream. With increasing discharge, secondary currents increase in strength. Consequently, the zone of maximum T and q, remains closer to the inside bank across the point bar, and crosses the channel centerline somewhat lower in the bend. It appears that bed geometry is adjusted to provide, at each point on the bed, precisely the shear stress necessary to transport the sediment load supplied. For example, the gradual decrease in depth along the down-valley side of the channel from the deep in one bend to the point bar in the next results in a continual acceleration of the flow, and hence in shear stresses here which are higher than average for the channel.},

The accuracy of model predictions is quantified through use of the reliability diagram and the associated root mean square error between uncertain predicted inundation and observed flooded proportion, and the precision measured through use of an entropy-like measure. The use of these two criteria is tested for the calibration and validation of a simple cellular flow model on a reach of the river Severn, UK, for which satellite imagery of flood extent for two events is available. The two measures give an insight into the differences between the calibration and validation processes and the effectiveness of data from different satellite sensors in constraining uncertain model parameters, and allow uncertainty and precision in model predictions to be quantified in a meaningful way.},

Two commonly used 2D depth-averaged models for bend-flow simulation are considered in this study of which the bend-flow model includes the dispersion stress terms by incorporating the assumption of secondary-current velocity profile, and the conventional model neglects the dispersion stress terms. The maximum relative discrepancy of the longitudinal velocity, obtained from the comparison of these two models, is used as a criterion to judge their applicability for bend-flow simulation. The analysis of simulation results indicated that the maximum relative difference in longitudinal velocity is mainly related to the relative strength of the secondary current and the relative length of the channel. Empirical relations between the maximum relative difference in the longitudinal velocity, the relative strength of the secondary current, and the relative length of the channel for both the channel-bend region and the straight region following the bend have been established. The proposed relations provide a guideline for model users to determine the proper approach to simulate the bend-flow problem by either using the conventional model or the bend-flow model. Experimental data have been adopted herein to demonstrate the applicability and to verify the accuracy of the proposed relations.},

Yet previous estimations of reservoir turbidity currents are mostly based on simple empirical relations and it remains unclear how and to what extent physically based numerical models can resolve current evolution as compared against field observations. This paper presents a physically-based, processresolved computational study of turbidity currents in the Xiaolangdi reservoir in the lower Yellow River, China. A coupled layer-averaged 2D numerical model is applied, which explicitly incorporates the interactions between the current, sediment transport and morphological evolution, and features a new wellbalanced numerical scheme dealing with irregular topography. Two turbidity current events in July 2004 are numerically simulated to calibrate and validate the model. The current advance and the sediment transport rate computed by the model compare favourably with field measurements. These suggest the present model is a viable tool for determining the timing for operating the bottom outlets, which is critical for effective reservoir sediment management. The sediment entrainment flux and bed resistance are key factors dictating the evolution of turbidity current and warrant further investigations.},

  abstract = {Learning efficient image representations is at the core of the scene classification task of remote sensing imagery. The existing methods for solving the scene classification task, based on either feature coding approaches with low-level hand-engineered features or unsupervised feature learning, can only generate mid-level image features with limited representative ability, which essentially prevents them from achieving better performance. Recently, the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are hierarchical architectures trained on large-scale datasets, have shown astounding performance in object recognition and detection. However, it is still not clear how to use these deep convolutional neural networks for high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) scene classification. In this paper, we investigate how to transfer features from these successfully pre-trained CNNs for HRRS scene classification. We propose two scenarios for generating image features via extracting CNN features from different layers. In the first scenario, the activation vectors extracted from fully-connected layers are regarded as the final image features; in the second scenario, we extract dense features from the last convolutional layer at multiple scales and then encode the dense features into global image features through commonly used feature coding approaches. Extensive experiments on two public scene classification datasets demonstrate that the image features obtained by the two proposed scenarios, even with a simple linear classifier, can result in remarkable performance and improve the state-of-the-art by a significant margin. The results reveal that the features from pre-trained CNNs generalize well to HRRS datasets and are more expressive than the low- and mid-level features. Moreover, we tentatively combine features extracted from different CNN models for better performance.},

Under the combined action of the vegetation and the bend flow, the flow structure is complex. The stream-wise velocities in the vegetation region are much smaller than those in the non-vegetation region due to the retardation caused by the vegetation. For the same reason, no clear circulation is found in the vegetated region, while in the non-vegetation region, a slight counter-rotating circulation is found near the outer bank at both 90o and downstream curved cross-sections. A comparison between the numerical prediction and the laboratory measurement shows that the RNG k - {$\epsilon$} model can well predict the flow structure of the bend flow with vegetation. Furthermore, the shear stress is analyzed based on the numerical prediction. The much smaller value in the inner vegetated region indicates that the vegetation can effectively protect the river bank from scouring and erosion, in other words, the sediment is more likely to be deposited in the vegetation region.},

The model simulates the bed topography, flow field, and bank erosion rate in an incised meandering channel. In a scenario where the upstream sediment load decreases (e.g., after dam closure or soil conservation), alluvial river experiences cross section deepening and slope flattening. The channel migration rate might be affected in two ways: decreased channel slope and steeped bank height. The proposed numerical model combines the traditional one-dimensional (1D) sediment transport model in simulating the channel erosion and the linear model for channel meandering. A non-equilibrium sediment transport model is used to update the channel bed elevation and gradations. A linear meandering model was used to calculate the channel alignment and bank erosion/accretion, which in turn was used by the 1D sediment transport model. In the 1D sediment transport model, the channel bed elevation and gradations are represented in each channel cross section. In the meandering model, the bed elevation and gradations are stored in two dimensional (2D) cells to represent the channel and terrain properties (elevation and gradation). A new method is proposed to exchange information regarding bed elevations and bed material fractions between 1D river geometry and 2D channel and terrain. The ability of the model is demonstrated using the simulation of the laboratory channel migration of Friedkin in which channel incision occurs at the upstream end.},

  abstract = {Prevention and remediation strategies for groundwater pollution can be successfully carried out if the location, concentration, and release history of contaminants can be accurately identified. This, however, presents a challenge due to complex groundwater systems. To address this issue, a simulation-optimization (S/O) model by integrating MODFLOW and MT3DMS into a shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) optimization algorithm was proposed; this coupled model can identify the unknown groundwater pollution source characteristics. Moreover, the Grids Traversal algorithm was used for automatically searching all possible combinations of pollution source location. The performance of the proposed S/O model was tested by three hypothetical scenarios with various combinations of mixed situations (i.e., single and multiple pollution source locations, known and unknown pollution source locations, steady-state flow and transient flow). The field measurement errors was additionally considered and analyzed. Our results showed that this proposed S/O model performed reasonably well. The identified locations and concentrations of contaminants fairly matched with the imposed inputs with average normalized deviations less than 1\% after sufficient generations. We further assessed the impact of generation number on the performance of the S/O model. The performance could be significantly improved by increasing generation number, which yet resulted in a heavy computational burden. Furthermore, the proposed S/O model performed more efficiently and robustly than the traditionally used artificial neural network (ANN)-based model. This is due to the internal linkage of numerical simulation in the S/O model that promotes the data exchange from external files to programming variables. This new model allows for solving the source-identification problems considering complex conditions, and thus for providing a platform for groundwater pollution prevention and management.},

  abstract = {The need for accurate determinations of the total sediment discharge of particles of bedload size has prompted this investigation of available and possible measuring apparatus and procedures. The accuracy of measurements of sediment discharge made with trap-type samplers is affected by the variability of sampler efficiency, by the oscillatory variation of bedload discharge, and by sampler placement. Equations that were developed for determining total discharge from measured bedioad discharge and measured suspended-sediment discharge are simplest if the bedload apparatus measures only the true bedload. Early bedload samplers are generally unsatisfactory. Recently developed or suggested apparatus include various improved samplers of the pressure-difference type, a pumping sampler, a magnetic sampler, acoustical instruments that measure the magnitude of the sound of particle collisions, an ultrasonic bedload sampler designed to measure and integrate electronically the concentration and velocity, and a tiltmeter designed to measure the total sediment discharge from the ground tilt that results from the passage of flow. All the pressure-difference samplers are improvements over early samplers, but none are void of the inherent shortcomings of trap-type apparatus; probably the Sphinx (Dutch) and VUV (Hungarian) samplers are the most satisfactory. The acoustical instruments are capable of measuring only the relative discharge. The ultrasonic sampler and the tiltmeter are not adequate without further development. Some new possible apparatus and means for measuring or aiding in measuring bedload discharge are small pit samplers, ultrasonic sounders, pressure transducers, and photography. A small pit sampler for measuring bedload discharge was designed to provide self-placement and portability ; however, its practicability and efficiency are undetermined. Exploratory films show that by using slowmotion photography the discharge of particles larger than about pea size can be determined provided the flow is clear; however, photography generally is not practical. Ultrasonic sounders provide continuous and accurate data on bed configuration and dune movement for use in equations that were developed for computing the bedload discharge. Computations with the equations indicate that the interpretation of the sounding data needs further study. Pressure transducers placed beneath the bed surface possibly can be used to provide information on dune movement; however, their installation would be difficult. The time required for collecting data on bed configuration and dune movement throughout a cross section could be substantially reduced by using several transducers simultaneously in conjunction with an ultrasonic sounder. A modified ultrasonic sounder that provides information on the shape and velocity of large particles and a method for determining the discharge of such particles were proposed; the method seems most feasible for particles of high sphericity.}

  author = {Huber Garc{\'i}a, Verena},
  year = {2020},
  month = jun,
  urldate = {2022-03-21},
  abstract = {In order to satisfy future demands for water, food, fibre and energy, it is necessary to develop management strategies that find a balance between ecological, economical and societal needs. This is particularly true for regions that are likely to be negatively affected by climate change, such as the Mediterranean. Many studies agree that altered precipitation patterns and higher mean temperatures will increase water scarcity in this region, which is already prone to water stress. At the same time, irrigation is by far the major water consumer in Mediterranean countries. Still, many river basin authorities plan to expand the irrigation activities consuming even more water while the natural supply diminishes. The work presented here concentrates on two Mediterranean river basins, the Ebro in Spain and the Evrotas in Greece. In case of the Ebro, the River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) foresees an expansion of approx. 50\% of the irrigated area for the future and a related rise of the water demand by 30\% until 2033. The irrigation in the Evrotas has been expanded to olive trees over the last decades increasing the water demand for irrigation substantially. Consequently, the reduced water availability caused by a changing climate in combination with an expected water demand increase are very likely to aggravate the situation in the future. Both river basins constitute case studies of the EU-FP7 project GLOBAQUA, which builds the thematic frame of this thesis. With a focus on aquatic ecosystems, one of the project aims was to investigate how future water-related management practices and policies, in particular the Water Framework Directive of the European Union (EU-WFD), have to be adapted to be able to cope with the impacts of multiple stressors, such as climate and land use change, under increased water scarcity in the future. One of the objectives of the work presented here was to analyse if the current and future official water management strategies in the study areas adhere to the EU-WFD, which promotes the sustainable use of water, and to sketch alternatives. For this purpose, integrated, spatially explicit land and water use scenarios were developed that reflect the water management practices of the individual study areas. The scenarios are, at the same time, in line with the global Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), a scenario framework widely used in climate change impact studies. Integration in this respect means that climate, socio-economic and environmental future projections were taken into account. To be able to apply these global storylines to regional study areas, they had to be downscaled first. Within the GLOBAQUA project, several project-specific scenarios were developed based on RCPs and SSPs for the time horizon 2050. Out of these, the MYOPIC and the SUSTAINABLE scenario were investigated in detail as part of this thesis. For both case studies the MYOPIC scenario represents the continuation of the `business as usual'; in case of the Ebro it is parametrised according to the plans reported in the RBMP mentioned above. The downscaling to the basin-scale was achieved by including the knowledge of experts and local stakeholders and combining it with quantitative values gathered through an extensive literature review. This information was further used to parametrise the land use change model iCLUE. Eventually, this resulted in land use maps for the MYOPIC and SUSTAINABLE scenario for the year 2050 for the Ebro and Evrotas. In order to obtain also spatially distributed water use maps, official water use statistics were combined with the spatially explicit land use simulations. Urban and industrial uses were linked to urban areas and agricultural uses, irrigation for the largest part, to all irrigated land use classes. For the future, the water consumption of each land use class was adapted with a factor to fit the overall water demand which was priorly specified for each scenario. In case of the Ebro, the final water use scenarios were compared to the Climate Moisture Index (CMI) to evaluate also the water availability under both scenarios. The validation of the land use simulations revealed that the performance of iCLUE in both case studies is good. Also the water use maps, which were compared to already existing similar products, are satisfying. The concerns regarding water management were confirmed: Already the current practices demand substantially more water than what could be considered sustainable. The long-term meanWater Exploitation Index Plus (WEI+) for the Ebro indicates water scarcity already for the present. The CMI projects a future reduction of available water independently of the scenario. If the RBMP is implemented as planned, it is certain that water scarcity will increase dramatically, resulting in a higher WEI+. Applying, however, a SUSTAINABLE scenario, the WEI+ would only rise marginally compared to the present. The situation is very similar for the Evrotas. The downscaling of the scenarios appeared to be not only useful but necessary to obtain the spatial and thematic resolution to support planning decisions on a river basin level. The proposed method for deriving water use maps based on local statistics rather than through modelling proved to be an easy to use tool. Its transferability in space, scale and resolution was confirmed by the application to the Evrotas basin. The work presented in this thesis describes a procedure that can help to better implement the Water Framework Directive of the European Union (EU-WFD). Such integrated modelling exercises, which address the systemic view of the directive, should be established as standard procedure to better assess the efficiency and applicability of Programmes of Measures (PoMs). The final recommendations of this thesis to the EU-WFD are to demand for a compulsory and standardised reporting on water related variables and to set quantitative targets such as the adherence to a certain WEI+ level. This would allow to better assess the sustainability of water management practices and facilitate the comparability across Europe.},

  abstract = {Currently, Southeast Europe (SEE) is witnessing a boom in hydropower plant (HPP) construction, which has not even spared protected areas. As SEE includes global hotspots of aquatic biodiversity, it is expected that this boom will result in a more severe impact on biodiversity than that of other regions. A more detailed assessment of the environmental risks resulting from HPP construction would have to rely on the existence of nearby hydrological and biological monitoring stations. For this reason, we review the distribution and trends of HPPs in the area, as well as the availability of hydrological and biological monitoring data from national institutions useable for environmental impact assessment. Our analysis samples tributary rivers of the Danube in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Montenegro, referred to hereafter as TRD rivers. Currently, 636 HPPs are operating along the course of TRD rivers, most of which are small ({$<$}1\,MW). An additional 1315 HPPs are currently planned to be built, mostly in Serbia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As official monitoring stations near HPPs are rare, the impact of those HPPs on river flow, fish and macroinvertebrates is difficult to assess. This manuscript represents the first regional review of hydropower use and of available data sources on its environmental impact for an area outside of the Alps. We conclude that current hydrological and biological monitoring in TRD rivers is insufficient for an assessment of the ecological impacts of HPPs. This data gap also prevents an adequate assessment of the ecological impacts of planned HP projects, as well as the identification of appropriate measures to mitigate the environmental effects of existing HPPs.},

  abstract = {We illustrate an approach to quantify patterns in hydraulic habitat composition and local heterogeneity applicable at low cost over very large river extents, with selectable reach window scales. Ongoing developments in remote sensing and geographical information science massively improve efficiencies in analyzing earth surface features. With the development of new satellite sensors and drone platforms and with the lowered cost of high resolution multispectral imagery, fluvial geomorphology is experiencing a revolution in mapping streams at high resolution. Exploiting the power of aerial or satellite imagery is particularly useful in a riverscape research framework (Fausch et al., 2002), where high resolution sampling of fluvial features and very large coverage extents are needed. This study presents a satellite remote sensing method that requires very limited field calibration data to estimate over various scales ranging from 1m to many tens or river kilometers (i) spatial composition metrics for key hydraulic mesohabitat types and (ii) reach-scale wetted habitat heterogeneity indices such as the hydromorphological index of diversity (HMID). When the purpose is hydraulic habitat characterization applied over long river networks, the proposed method (although less accurate) is much less computationally expensive and less data demanding than two dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Here, we illustrate the tools based on a Worldview 2 satellite image of the Kiamika River, near Mont Laurier, Quebec, Canada, specifically over a 17-km river reach below the Kiamika dam. In the first step, a high resolution water depth (D) map is produced from a spectral band ratio (calculated from the multispectral image), calibrated with limited field measurements. Next, based only on known river discharge and estimated cross section depths at time of image capture, empirical-based pseudo-2D hydraulic rules are used to rapidly generate a two-dimensional map of flow velocity (V) over the 17-km Kiamika reach. The joint distribution of D and V variables over wetted zones then is used to reveal structural patterns in hydraulic habitat availability at patch, reach, and segment scales. Here we analyze 156 bivariate (D, V) density function plots estimated over moving reach windows along the satellite scene extent to extract 14 physical habitat metrics (such as river width, mean and modal depths and velocity, variances and covariance in D and V over 1-m pixels, HMID, entropy). A principal component analysis on the set of metrics is then used to cluster river reaches in regard to similarity in their hydraulic habitat composition and heterogeneity. Applications of this approach can include (i) specific fish habitat detection at riverscape scales (e.g., large areas of riffle spawning beds, deeper pools) for regional management, (ii) studying how river habitat heterogeneity is correlated to fish distribution and (iii) guidance for site location for restoration of key habitats or for post regulation monitoring of representative reaches of various types.},

  abstract = {The idea that models should be as simple as possible is often accepted without question. However, too much simplification and parsimony may degrade a model's utility. Models are often constructed to make predictions; yet, they are commonly parameterized with a focus on calibration, regardless of whether (1) the calibration data can constrain simulated predictions or (2) the number and type of calibration parameters are commensurate with the hydraulic property details on which key predictions may depend. Parameterization estimated through the calibration process is commonly limited by the necessity that the number of calibration parameters be smaller than the number of observations. This limitation largely stems from historical restrictions in calibration and computing capability; we argue here that better methods and computing capabilities are now available and should become more widely used. To make this case, two approaches to model calibration are contrasted: (1) a traditional approach based on a small number of homogeneous parameter zones defined by the modeler a priori and (2) regularized inversion, which includes many more parameters than the traditional approach. We discuss some advantages of regularized inversion, focusing on the increased insight that can be gained from calibration data. We present these issues using reasoning that we believe has a common sense appeal to modelers; knowledge of mathematics is not required to follow our arguments. We present equations in an Appendix, however, to illustrate the fundamental differences between traditional model calibration and a regularized inversion approach.},

Increasingly, bioengineered approaches using vegetation-based constructive materials is promoted to alleviate some of the negative ecological stresses of bank stabilization. Because these stabilization projects use a variety of techniques to create a site-specific design, they can have unexpected morphological implications and variable ecological benefits which can be anticipated using numerical modelling. Bioengineered bank stabilization creates roughness elements on both micro and macro scales, where only macro-roughness can be captured by bathymetric adjustments. The definition of micro- and macro-roughness depends on the spatial resolution of the model domain, and may be considered analogous to skin and form friction when characterizing natural alluvial bed environments. The objectives of this research are to assess the hydrodynamic impact of the added micro- and macro-roughness associated with a bioengineering pilot project planned in Quebec, Canada and to use this case study to propose new techniques for integrating increased roughness due to bank stabilization into numerical models. The roughness of the stabilization project is assessed by adjusting bathymetry to simulate macro-roughness features, and roughness coefficients to simulate micro-roughness features. Results show a significant dampening interaction term that reduced the cumulative effect on resistance to flow when both roughness types were applied.},

  abstract = {The cryosphere in mountain regions is rapidly declining, a trend that is expected to accelerate over the next several decades due to anthropogenic climate change. A cascade of effects will result, extending from mountains to lowlands with associated impacts on human livelihood, economy, and ecosystems. With rising air temperatures and increased radiative forcing, glaciers will become smaller and, in some cases, disappear, the area of frozen ground will diminish, the ratio of snow to rainfall will decrease, and the timing and magnitude of both maximum and minimum streamflow will change. These changes will affect erosion rates, sediment, and nutrient flux, and the biogeochemistry of rivers and proglacial lakes, all of which influence water quality, aquatic habitat, and biotic communities. Changes in the length of the growing season will allow low-elevation plants and animals to expand their ranges upward. Slope failures due to thawing alpine permafrost, and outburst floods from glacier- and moraine-dammed lakes will threaten downstream populations. Societies even well beyond the mountains depend on meltwater from glaciers and snow for drinking water supplies, irrigation, mining, hydropower, agriculture, and recreation. Here, we review and, where possible, quantify the impacts of anticipated climate change on the alpine cryosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere, and consider the implications for adaptation to a future of mountains without permanent snow and ice.},

Dimensional analysis via the Buckingham pi theorem is used to suggest that the dimensionless clogging depth can be potentially collapsed using the original and adjusted bed-to-grain ratios, i.e.,~ratio of substrate diameter to fine sediment diameter, substrate porosity, roughness Reynolds number, and Peclet number. Macroanalysis and statistical analysis is performed using 10 previously published studies that include a total of 146 different test conditions reporting noncohesive, fine sediment clogging, or deposition in porous gravel-beds with hydraulically rough turbulent open channel flow. Results suggest that the adjusted bed-to-grain ratio is a reliable predictor of the initiation of clogging with clogging occurring below 27 for the fine fluvial sediment clogging in a gravel bed substrate for hydraulically rough turbulent flow flumes considered. The original and adjusted bed-to-grain ratios show little influence on the depth of clogging once the lower threshold for bed filling is reached. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the bed-to-grain ratio is not used to predict the maximum depth of clogging. Rather, results suggest that the dimensionless clogging depth can be collapsed using the substrate porosity and roughness Reynolds number reflecting the impact of the pore water velocity distribution on the dispersion of fine sediment into the gravel substrate. The clogging depth results are used to estimate the clogging profile for fine sands in gravel substrate for the datasets.},

First, the noise particle set of the pixels in the gray transition region of the target edge at the initial time was established, posterior probability density of noise particle was acquired through the recursive Bayesian estimation method, and disturbances on pixels of the gray transition region of the target edge was eliminated. Then, the iterate result of the precise edge position was estimated for the instability of the grey value of pixels in the gray transition region of the target edge. Finally, the geometrical parameters of the target concerned were solved with the computation of the data of the complete contour extracted. Using the method, the angle measurement accuracy is less than 0.0068 degrees, and the standard deviation is 0.00123; the diameter ratio measurement accuracy is less than 0.00057 degrees, and the standard deviation is 8.67215E-5. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm can quickly and precisely achieve the noise elimination and image segmentation.},

In this paper, we develop a variant of the CMA-ES for multi-objective optimization (MOO). We first introduce a single-objective, elitist CMA-ES using plus-selection and step size control based on a success rule. This algorithm is compared to the standard CMA-ES. The elitist CMA-ES turns out to be slightly faster on unimodal functions, but is more prone to getting stuck in sub-optimal local minima. In the new multi-objective CMAES (MO-CMA-ES) a population of individuals that adapt their search strategy as in the elitist CMA-ES is maintained. These are subject to multi-objective selection. The selection is based on non-dominated sorting using either the crowding-distance or the contributing hypervolume as second sorting criterion. Both the elitist single-objective CMA-ES and the MO-CMA-ES inherit important invariance properties, in particular invariance against rotation of the search space, from the original CMA-ES. The benefits of the new MO-CMA-ES in comparison to the well-known NSGA-II and to NSDE, a multi-objective differential evolution algorithm, are experimentally shown.},

The model for bed topography is derived by considering the sediment balance for bed load and suspended load, the transport rate and direction, all of which are governed by the three-dimensional flow.

Observed changes in the grain size distribution, bed elevation, and crosssection pre- and post-weir removal are provided and discussed in this paper. Various bed zones such as a sand island and a vegetated marshy zone, which can diversify an aquatic habitat, formed after the removal. In fact, changes in the number of observed fish species post-removal also were investigated. Finally, specific changes to the physical habitat of Zacco platypus were numerically simulated using the River2D model. The results indicated that habitat suitability post-removal was enhanced for all flow discharges. The WUA values increased 32.3{\textendash}53.4\% for all life stages in the flow discharge of 1.5 m3 s-1.

  abstract = {Although plastic debris is constantly accumulating in aquatic environments, the impact on aquatic ecosystems is not yet fully understood. A first important step to assess the consequences of plastic debris in aquatic ecosystems is the establishment of a reliable, verified, and standardized method to quantify the amount of plastic particles in the environment. We improved the density separation approach by the construction of the so called Munich Plastic Sediment Separator (MPSS). It enables a reliable separation of different ecologically relevant size classes of plastic particles from sediment samples. A ZnCl2-solution (1.6{\textendash}1.7 kg/L) as separation fluid allows for an extraction of plastic particles ranging from large fragments to small microplastic particles (S-MPP, {$<$}1 mm). Subsequent identification and quantification of the particles with spatial resolution down to 1 {\textmu}m can be performed using Raman microspectroscopy. Our study is the first providing validated recovery rates of 100\% for large microplastic particles (L-MPP, 1{\textendash}5 mm) and 95.5\% for S-MPP. The recovery rate for S-MPP, using the MPSS, was significantly higher than the value obtained by application of classical density separation setup (39.8\%). Moreover, our recovery rates were significantly higher than those based on froth flotation (55.0\% for L-MPP) commonly used in recycling industries. Hence, our improved method can be used for a reliable and time-efficient separation, identification and quantification of plastic fragments down to S-MPP. This will help foster studies quantifying the increasing contamination of aquatic environments with microplastic particles, which is a crucial prerequisite for future risk assessment and management strategies.},

In this paper, an innovative approach is presented which incorporates remote sensing derived evapotranspiration in the calibration of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in a catchment of the Krishna basin in southern India. The Gauss{\textendash}Marquardt{\textendash}Levenberg algorithm is implemented to optimise different combination of land use, soil, groundwater, and meteorological model parameters. In the best performing optimisation, the r2 between monthly sub-basin simulated and measured actual evapotranspiration (ETact) was increased from 0.40 to 0.81. ETact was more sensitive to the groundwater and meteorological parameters than the soil and land use parameters. Traditional calibration on a limited number of discharge stations lumps all hydrological processes together and chances on the equifinality problem are larger. In this study we have shown this problem can be constrained by using spatially distributed observations with a monthly temporal resolution. At a spatial resolution below the sub-basin level further study is required to fine-tune the calibration procedure.},

  abstract = {Numerous measures are used in the literature to describe the grain-size distribution of sediments. Consideration of these measures indicates that parameters computed from quartiles may not be as significant as those based on more rigorous statistical concepts. In addition, the lack of standardization of descriptive measures has resulted in limited application of the findings from one locality to another. The use of five parameters that serve as approximate graphic analogies to the moment measures commonly employed in statistics is recommended. The parameters are computed from five percentile diameters obtained from the cumulative size-frequency curve of a sediment. They include the mean (or median) diameter, standard deviation, kurtosis, and two measures of skewness, the second measure being sensitive to skew properties of the "tails" of the sediment distribution. If the five descriptive measures are listed for a sediment, it is possible to compute the five percentile diameters on which they are based (phi 5 , phi 16 , phi 50 , phi 84 , and phi 95 ), and hence five significant points on the cumulative carve of the sediment. This increases the value of the data listed for a sediment in a report, and in many cases eliminates the necessity of including the complete mechanical analysis of the sediment. The degree of correlation of the graphic parameters to the corresponding moment measures decreases as the distribution becomes more skew. However, for a fairly wide range of distributions, the first three moment measures can be ascertained from the graphic parameters with about the same degree of accuracy as is obtained by computing rough moment measures.}

  abstract = {With the aim to improve current knowledge on physical processes in tropical and subtropical reservoirs, we explored the dynamics of prevailing hydrodynamic processes in a small- to medium-sized reservoir based on 1-year continuous measurements of temperature, flow velocity, and turbulence. The mixing regime of the reservoir is characterized as warm polymictic, and extended periods of comparably strong density stratification were observed during all seasons, interrupted by several mixing periods between autumn and winter. The stratification was affected by lateral, density-driven flows from the main river inflow. A forebay through which the river enters the reservoir influenced the density currents and reduced the occurrence of underflows. Flow velocities in the middle of the reservoir were generally small, and higher velocities (currents {$>$}3.5 cm s-1) were driven by wind. These currents were more frequent during stratified than during mixed periods. No basin-scale internal waves (seiches) were observed, but, high-frequency internal waves propagating, with periods between 2 and 17 min were present in all seasons. Dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy were generally small (10-10{\textendash}10-9 W kg-1). Wind-driven currents were associated with enhanced dissipation rates at the bottom-boundary layer but represented only 10\% of the total monitored period. We identified several aspects in which the observed hydrodynamics of the reservoir differed from those of more commonly studied temperate aquatic systems. We expect that our findings are representative for a large number of small- to medium-sized lakes and for a growing number of reservoirs located in the tropical and subtropical zone.},

  abstract = {The haor landscape is a wetland ecosystem in northeast Bangladesh, comprising shallow depressions that undergo large changes in water inundation between the monsoon and dry seasons. Sediment is supplied to the haor from rivers originating in the adjacent Shillong Plateau, and can adversely affect these largely arable agricultural lands. The critical adverse effects of changing hydrology and enhanced sedimentation due to anthropogenic change include the reduction of natural water storage capacity, changes in the timing and magnitude of floods, and increasing loss and damage to crops, which consequently affect the livelihoods of wetland dwellers. This study employs a mixed-methods approach to investigate how sedimentation has affected the livelihoods of the residents and the pressures they experience. Cross-sectional surveys and interviews were conducted with 180 respondents in Lubar and Pochashul Haors (LPH), Sunamganj District, and allied with an analysis of satellite images that reveals the nature of landscape change over the past 56 years. Our findings confirm that sedimentation has been promoted through both natural processes of alluvial fan progradation and anthropogenic forcings. Enhanced sedimentation threatens the agriculture of the region and affects the livelihood of local inhabitants, leading to other societal issues related to income, education, employment, health, displacement, and sexual harassment. The mixed methods employed herein are essential tools to reveal these effects. In order to reduce the vulnerability of the local population, a transboundary dialog between India and Bangladesh is needed to realize measures to protect wetland resources and achieve progress towards environmental sustainability.},

In river bends, secondary currents, which are three-dimensional (3D) flow structures caused by a balance between centrifugal force and pressure gradient, has important roles for flow structure and the sediment transport. Therefore, a numerical model, which can reproduce this 3D flow structure, is required to describe the morphodynamic phenomena in meandering rivers. This study employed the depth-averaged 2D shallow water equations' integrated effect of secondary currents of the first kind for flow calculations. This flow model can consider the effect of lag between the developments of secondary current and streamline curvatures. In addition, we employed the equilibrium sediment transport model and a multiple layer model for simulating the sediment transport and sorting phenomena due to non-uniform sediments. This study applied the different kind of model for evaluating the secondary current and sediment transport to a meandering channel with simple-rectangular sine-generated curve. We examined the applicability of models and morphodynamic process in a meandering channel through the comparison between the experimental and numerical results. The result shows that the correlation for secondary currents for flow structures and sediment transport is important to reproduce the bed evolution and sorting phenomena in river bends.},

Here we investigate the development of meandering channel in a river, which was originally braided and currently vegetated, the Otofuke River in Japan. The significant morphological processes of this river during a destructive flood event was studied using a two-dimensional morphodynamic model. Using well-calibrated parameters, this model qualitatively reproduced observed morphological changes such as the co-development of sand bars, bar-induced meandering and a chute cutoff. We find that for vegetated channels, meandering could maintain moderate sinuosity; in contrast, in the absence of riparian vegetation, bar-induced meandering channels could become braided. This suggests that distinct meandering channels could be a fundamental channel morphology in the originally braided, but currently vegetated river; however, the simultaneous occurrence of the chute cutoff and meandering indicates that this channel could not be a fully-developed high amplitude meandering channel.},

Applications involve a broad range of steady-state or transient water flow, solute transport, and/or heat transfer problems. They include both short-term, one-dimensional laboratory column flow or transport simulations, as well as more complex, long-duration, multi-dimensional field studies. The HYDRUS models can be used for both direct problems when the initial and boundary conditions for all involved processes and corresponding model parameters are known, as well as inverse problems when some of the parameters need to be calibrated or estimated from observed data. The approach to model calibration and validation may vary widely depending upon the complexity of the application. Model calibration and inverse parameter estimation can be carried out using a relatively simple, gradient-based, local optimization approach based on the Marquardt-Levenberg method, which is directly implemented into the HYDRUS codes, or more complex global optimization methods, including genetic algorithms, which need to be run separately from HYDRUS. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the HYDRUS codes, discuss which HYDRUS parameters can be estimated using internally built optimization routines and which type of experimental data can be used for this, and review various calibration approaches that have been used in the literature in combination with the HYDRUS codes.},

The extraction method seemed to be especially suitable for extracting humic substances and proteins from biofilms but also carbohydrate could be extracted, depending on the nature of the sample. Extraction conditions must be well defined because the extraction efficiency was dependent on stirring intensity, amount of cation exchange resin and extraction time. Up to 20\% of the total biofilm protein was found in the DOWEX-extractable fraction. No significant cell-lysis up to 2 hours of extraction time could be detected by acridine orange (AO) direct counts. The same was true when applying the extraction method to a batch culture of P. putida. However, the number of viable cells in the batch culture as recorded by plate count technique was reduced to 28\% after 30 min of extraction. In conclusion, proteins and humic substances can be extracted from biofilm EPS in considerable amounts and should be investigated more in detail when analysing the properties of the EPS matrix of a biofilm.},

An estimated 10 million hectares of agricultural lands are degraded and turned into un-farmable areas due to soil erosion thus resulting in reduced food production for the 3.7 billion malnourished people as reported by World Health Organization. Estimation of soil erosion loss and evaluation of soil erosion risk has become an urgent task by many nations before implementing soil conservation practices. There is now a large published literature on the application of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation known as the RUSLE model in combination with GIS technology for predicting soil loss and erosion risks in different regions. This review paper assesses the current literature on the combined application of RUSLE and GIS, examining new developments in deriving the five RUSLE components. The literature review shows that using the traditional RUSLE model in mapping out soil erosion in large watersheds poses challenges. The combined effect of RUSLE and GIS provides a useful and efficient tool for predicting long-term soil erosion potential and assessing soil erosion impacts. However, there is a need to further investigate better ways of deriving the conservation and management factor (P) in the RUSLE for better on future studies. Data source and quality is also another key issue in GIS application, thus great care must be given in checking and pre-processing GIS data, including conversion to different formats, geo-referencing, data interpolation and registration. Finally, validation of the soil erosion loss using reference data is also a valuable input towards improving the quality and correctness of the results.},

Data from the Nagwa and Karso catchments in Bihar (India) have been used. The Integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS) GIS package has been used for carrying out geographic analyses. An Earth Resources Data Analysis System (ERDAS) Imagine image processor has been used for the digital analysis of satellite data for deriving the land cover and soil characteristics of the catchments. The catchments were discretized into hydrologically homogeneous grid cells to capture the catchment heterogeneity. The cells thus formed were then differentiated into cells of overland flow regions and cells of channel flow regions based on the magnitude of their flow accumulation areas. The gross soil erosion in each cell was calculated using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USEE) by carefully determining its various parameters. The concept of sediment delivery ratio (SDR) was used for determination of the total sediment yield of each catchment during isolated storm events.},

Significant reduction in the attachment of all the six cultures to glass (p = 0.02) and polystyrene (p = 0.03) was observed after DNP treatment. Moreover, hydrophobicity but not the cell surface charge or EPS production influenced bacterial cell attachment to glass and polystyrene.

The new approach is an extension of previous models and accounts for multiple sediment size classes, has a unified treatment of suspended load and bedload, and appropriately replicates bed armouring. The resulting flow, transport, and sediment dynamics model is an improvement to previous models because it may directly incorporate site-specific data, while maintaining a physically consistent, unified treatment of bedload and suspended load. Experimental data from a noncohesive sediment erosion experiment in a straight channel help validate the numerical model.

  abstract = {Aquaculture structures comprising suspended canopies extending from the free surface to a point above the sediment are represented as porous blockages in a hydrodynamic surface-water model. These canopies alter flow conditions and material transport within and around the structure, especially between the bottom of the canopy and the sediment bed. These altered flow conditions can have significant implications for sediment, nutrient, and waste transport in the environments in which aquaculture structures are placed. This study uses an augmented version of the Environmental Fluid Dynamic Code to model flow conditions in and around a suspended canopy calibrated against data obtained from a series of flume tests. The parameter estimation code, PEST, was used to calibrate various model parameters including horizontal momentum diffusivity, vertical eddy viscosity, turbulence closure constants, and depthdependent drag coefficients to ensure that model simulations match the experimental (calibration) data comprising vertical velocity and turbulent kinetic energy profiles. The model was then validated against vertical profiles of turbulent kinetic energy production rate, which were not used during the calibration process. Ultimately, trends of increasing average drag coefficient with decreasing canopy blockage ratio and increasing average flume flow speed were observed. The calibrated canopyturbulence parameters may yield improved predictions of the hydrodynamic and material transport conditions resulting from the various aquaculture structures and flow systems. In turn, these predictions will help develop methods to minimize environmental impacts and to increase production from aquaculture farms.},

The literature indicates that the majority of enteric bacteria in aquatic systems are associated with sediments and that these associations influence their survival and transport characteristics. Yet, the nature of these associations has not been fully characterized. In this study, a combination of field experiments and mathematical modeling were used to better understand the processes which control the fate and transport of enteric bacteria in alluvial streams. An experimental procedure, involving the use of a tracer-bacteria, was developed to simulate the transport and deposition of bacteria-laden bed sediments in a small alluvial stream during steady flow conditions. The experimental data and mathematical model were used to determine dispersion coefficients, deposition rates, and partitioning coefficients for sediment-associated bacteria in two natural streams. The results provided evidence that bacterial adsorption can be modeled as an irreversible process in freshwater environments. Net settling velocities of fine sediments and associated bacteria were typically two orders of magnitude lower than those predicted from Stokes equation, due to re-entrainment of settled particles. The information presented in this study will further the development of representative microbial water quality models. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes and validates two new particle regularization techniques for the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical method to improve its stability and accuracy for free surface flow simulations. We introduce a general form of the Dynamic pair-wise Particle Collision (DPC) regularization technique that we recently proposed in the context of the Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method in [1]. The DPC coupled with the standard Particle Shifting (PS) technique has given rise to a hybrid approach that we propose to alleviate particle clustering issues in the free-surface and splashed regions. We validate the proposed techniques to four benchmark cases: (i) the oscillating droplet, (ii) the two-dimensional water dam-break, (iii) the two-dimensional water sloshing, and (iv) the three-dimensional water dam break against a rigid obstacle. We evaluate their impacts on the stability, accuracy and the conservation properties of the test cases. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results shows that despite its simplicity, the DPC technique is more effective in reducing the spatial disorder and capturing the impact events compared with the standard and the newly improved hybrid PS methods. Although the hybrid PS technique improves particle distribution at the free surface, it still suffers from the inconsistent implementation of the PS equation which unphysically increases the fluid volume and violates the conservation of potential energy in the long-term simulations. Overall, the conservative DPC algorithm proves to be a simple and efficient alternative regularization technique for simulating such highly dynamic free-surface flows.},

The unique experimental data include measurements of the time-averaged surface water flow velocities, the pressure distribution at the sediment{\textendash}water interface, and pore water flow paths. The modeling approach first simulates the time-averaged turbulent flow in the channel with CFD and then uses the predicted pressure distribution at the sediment{\textendash}water interface to drive a flow and transport model for the sediment. The CFD-modeled velocity and pressure distribution and transient particle tracks within the sediment agree reasonably well with observations. Differences that exist between observations and simulations mainly concern the eddies in the wake zone downstream of the ripple crests that are slightly shorter than those predicted by the model. This deviation propagates from the surface to the subsurface domain, appearing in the pressure distribution along the bed and, consequently, the subsurface flow patterns. The good representation of general patterns and rates makes multiphysics CFD modeling a powerful and sufficiently accurate tool that can replace measurements for many studies of surface{\textendash}subsurface processes involving current-exposed immobile bed forms. The approach can be used for predicting transport processes where they cannot easily be observed, such as in large rivers and coastal systems where boundary conditions such as mean currents and bed forms can be mapped.},

Where groundwater levels lie below nearby streams, streamwater can infiltrate through the streambed, reducing streamflow and recharging the aquifer3. These `losing' streams have important implications for water availability, riparian ecosystems and environmental flows4{\textendash}10, but the prevalence of losing streams remains poorly constrained by continent-wide in situ observations. Here we analyse water levels in 4.2 million wells across the contiguous USA and show that nearly two-thirds (64 per cent) of them lie below nearby stream surfaces, implying that these streamwaters will seep into the subsurface if it is sufficiently permeable. A lack of adequate permeability data prevents us from quantifying the magnitudes of these subsurface flows, but our analysis nonetheless demonstrates widespread potential for streamwater losses into underlying aquifers. These potentially losing rivers are more common in drier climates, flatter landscapes and regions with extensive groundwater pumping. Our results thus imply that climatic factors, geological conditions and historic groundwater pumping jointly contribute to the widespread risk of streams losing flow into surrounding aquifers instead of gaining flow from them. Recent modelling studies10 have suggested that losing streams could become common in future decades, but our direct observations show that many rivers across the USA are already potentially losing flow, highlighting the importance of coordinating groundwater and surface water policy.},

  abstract = {Computational models in neuroscience can be used to predict causal relationships between biological mechanisms in neurons and networks, such as the effect of blocking an ion channel or synaptic connection on neuron activity. Since developing a biophysically realistic, single neuron model is exceedingly difficult, software has been developed for automatically adjusting parameters of computational neuronal models. The ideal optimization software should work with commonly used neural simulation software; thus, we present software which works with models specified in declarative format for the MOOSE simulator. Experimental data can be specified using one of two different file formats. The fitness function is customizable as a weighted combination of feature differences. The optimization itself uses the covariance matrix adaptation-evolutionary strategy, because it is robust in the face of local fluctuations of the fitness function, and deals well with a high-dimensional and discontinuous fitness landscape. We demonstrate the versatility of the software by creating several model examples of each of four types of neurons (two subtypes of spiny projection neurons and two subtypes of globus pallidus neurons) by tuning to current clamp data. Optimizations reached convergence within 1,600{\textendash}4,000 model evaluations (200{\textendash}500 generations {\texttimes} population size of 8). Analysis of the parameters of the best fitting models revealed differences between neuron subtypes, which are consistent with prior experimental results. Overall our results suggest that this easy-to-use, automatic approach for finding neuron channel parameters may be applied to current clamp recordings from neurons exhibiting different biochemical markers to help characterize ionic differences between other neuron subtypes.},

Aquatic food security is achieved when a food supply is sufficient, safe, sustainable, shockproof and sound: sufficient, to meet needs and preferences of people; safe, to provide nutritional benefit while posing minimal health risks; sustainable, to provide food now and for future generations; shock-proof, to provide resilience to shocks in production systems and supply chains; and sound, to meet legal and ethical standards for welfare of animals, people and environment. Here, we present an integrated assessment of these elements of the aquatic food system in the United Kingdom, a system linked to dynamic global networks of producers, processors and markets. Our assessment addresses sufficiency of supply from aquaculture, fisheries and trade; safety of supply given biological, chemical and radiation hazards; social, economic and environmental sustainability of production systems and supply chains; system resilience to social, economic and environmental shocks; welfare of fish, people and environment; and the authenticity of food. Conventionally, these aspects of the food system are not assessed collectively, so information supporting our assessment is widely dispersed. Our assessment reveals trade-offs and challenges in the food system that are easily overlooked in sectoral analyses of fisheries, aquaculture, health, medicine, human and fish welfare, safety and environment. We highlight potential benefits of an integrated, systematic and ongoing process to assess security of the aquatic food system and to predict impacts of social, economic and environmental change on food supply and demand.},

  abstract = {Measurements were made of the erosion rates and bulk properties of sediments from eleven sites in the Grand River in Michigan. High concentrations of gas, up to 5\% by volume, were present in the sediments; this significantly affected the sediment bulk densities and erosion rates. Sediments from one of these sites were reconstructed (thoroughly mixed and then allowed to consolidate) in the laboratory where the time-dependent effects of gas generation on the densities and erosion rates of these sediments were quantified. In consolidation studies, the density was a function of depth, time, and temperature; it increased because of pore waters moving up and out of the solid-water matrix and decreased because of gas generation and movement. At higher temperatures, the rate of gas generation and the gas volume were greater and the bulk density was lower than at the lower temperatures. For the same bulk properties, temperatures, and shear stresses, erosion rates for the field and reconstructed sediments were the same. For reconstructed sediments at approximately 20{\textdegree}C, the effects of gas were to decrease the sediment densities by up to 10\%, to increase the erosion rates by as much as a factor of sixty, and to decrease the critical shear stress for erosion by as much as a factor of twenty compared to sediments with no gas present. At lower temperatures, these effects decreased significantly.},

We then solve the two wave regimes separately using appropriate state-of-the-art techniques, and re-combine the resulting wave velocities at the end of each step. This strategy leads to the first heightfield wave model capable of simulating complex interactions between both deep and shallow water effects, like the waves from a boat wake sloshing up onto a beach, or a dam break producing wave interference patterns and eddies. We also analyze the numerical dispersion created by our method and derive an exact correction factor for waves at a constant water depth, giving us a numerically perfect re-creation of theoretical water wave dispersion patterns.},

Whether it also determines carbon burial rates remains controversial. We investigated the effect of varying oxygen concentrations (170 to 0 {$\mu$}M O2) on microbial remineralization of organic matter in seafloor sediments and on community diversity of the northwestern Crimean shelf break. This study shows that 50\% more organic matter is preserved in surface sediments exposed to hypoxia compared to oxic bottom waters. Hypoxic conditions inhibit bioturbation and decreased remineralization rates even within short periods of a few days. These conditions led to the accumulation of threefold more phytodetritus pigments within 40 years compared to the oxic zone. Bacterial community structure also differed between oxic, hypoxic, and anoxic zones. Functional groups relevant in the degradation of particulate organic matter, such as Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria, changed with decreasing oxygenation, and the microbial community of the hypoxic zone took longer to degrade similar amounts of deposited reactive matter. We conclude that hypoxic bottom-water conditions{\textemdash}even on short time scales{\textemdash}substantially increase the preservation potential of organic matter because of the negative effects on benthic fauna and particle mixing and by favoring anaerobic processes, including sulfurization of matter.}

The efficient element method is applied to discretize the governing equations, and the time marching technique is used for temporal variations. The moving boundaries were treated by locating the wet and dry nodes automatically in the cases of simulating unsteady flows with changing free surface elevation in channels with irregular bed and bank topography. Two eddy viscosity models, a depth-averaged parabolic model and a depth-averaged mixing length model, are used as turbulent closures. Channel morphological changes are computed with considerations of the effects of bed slope and the secondary flow in curved channels. Physical model data have been used to verify this model with satisfactory results. The feasibility studies of simulating morphological formation in meandering channels and flows in natural streams with instream structures have been conducted to demonstrate its applicability to hydraulic engineering research/design studies of stream stabilization and ecological quality among other problems.},

The three-dimensional flow fields around a SW, the influence of the SW on general HSC, and the implication of effectiveness of submerged weirs to realign the flow field and improve navigability in bendways were analyzed. The numerical simulations indicated that the SW significantly altered the general HSC. Its presence induced a skewed pressure difference cross its top and a triangular-shaped recirculation to the downstream side.

However, bank erosion is also affected by the hydrodynamics of the channel flow, the shear stress due to the flow would erode the bed (bank toe) and the bank surfaces resulting in not only sediment yield directly but also more potential mass failures.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a three-dimensional (3-D) numerical model to simulate morphological changes in alluvial channels due to bank erosion. A method for the simulation of bank erosion is established. This is incorporated into a 3-D mathematical model for turbulent flow and non-uniform, non-equilibrium sediment transport. This model is applied to simulate morphological changes in the Shishou bend of the middle Yangtze River in China, where serious bank erosions occurred during the last two decades. The double-layer sediment structure of the riverbank on the middle Yangtze River is taken into account in the bank erosion module. Both cohesive and non-cohesive bank material in the different layers are considered. The bank erosion module also includes other factors affecting the rate of bank erosion, such as the longitudinal length of failed bank, the thickness of each layer in the double-layer structure, and the erosion-resisting effect of cohesive material from the top layer of failed bank. A locally-adaptive grid system is proposed to efficiently simulate the lateral migration of alluvial channel due to bank erosion. The predictive capability of the 3-D model is examined by laboratory data. Simulated processes of bank erosion agree with field observations in the Shishou bend during the period of October 1996{\textendash}October 1998, and the bank erosion module plays a significant role in simulating morphological changes of the study reach. In addition, the equivalent channel-forming discharge, which is defined as a constant discharge that can create the same amount of bank erosion in an alluvial channel as that created by natural runoff processes during the same period of time, is proposed to improve calculation efficiency for feasibility studies.},

  abstract = {Lateral migration is an important form of morphological changes on the Middle Yangtze River (MYR), particularly for the lower Jingjiang reach. The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) has substantially reduced sediment supply to the downstream river channels since its impoundment in June 2003. The scientific understanding of how decrease of sediment influences the processes of bank erosion and channel adjustments is complex and limited. In the present paper, the morphological responses in a typical meandering and island-braided river segment of the MYR to the filling of the TGR were investigated by a 3-D morphodynamic model. The potential of the 3-D model has been demonstrated by the observed data. The morphological evolutions in the Shishou bend during the first 12 years of the TGR impoundment were predicted. The effects of the TGR operation on the planform evolutions in the study reach were analyzed based on the simulated results. Sediment load is decreased by 75\% due to the early filling of the TGR. The magnitude of bed degradation with less sediment load due to the TGR operation is increased compared with the pre-dam situation. Qualitatively, the overall planform evolution trends in the Shishou bend after the TGR operation are similar to that without the TGR operation. The magnitude of lateral migration has been increased in some part of the channel bend, where the morphological response of the TGR operation exhibits more lateral migration rather than vertical degradation. Scouring at the bank toe enhances bank failure. Decrease of sediment load and weak bank anti-scour ability as well as the significant helical flow can be responsible for intensified bank erosion in the channel bend. \& 2016 International Research and Training Centre on Erosion and Sedimentation/the World Association for Sedimentation and Erosion Research.

Each slave swarm independently executes PSO or its variants, including the update of particles' position and velocity. For the master swarm, the particles enhance themselves based on the social knowledge of master swarm and that of slave swarms. At periodic stage in the evolution, the master swarm and the whole slave swarms are forced to mix, and points are then reassigned to several subswarms to ensure the share of information. The process is repeated until a user-defined stopping criterion is reached. The tests of numerical simulation and the case study on hydrological model show that MSSE-PSO remarkably improves the accuracy of calibration, reduces the time of computation and enhances the performance of stability.

  abstract = {Quantification of uncertainty of hydrological models has attracted much attention in hydrologic research in recent years. Many methods for quantification of uncertainty have been reported in the literature, of which GLUE and formal Bayesian method are the two most popular methods. There have been many discussions in the literature concerning differences between these two methods in theory (mathematics) and results, and this paper focuses on the computational efficiency and differences in their results, but not on philosophies and mathematical rigor that both methods rely on. By assessing parameter and modeling uncertainty of a simple conceptual water balance model (WASMOD) with the use of GLUE and formal Bayesian method, the paper evaluates differences in the results of the two methods and discusses the reasons for these differences. The main findings of the study are that: (1) the parameter posterior distributions generated by the Bayesian method are slightly less scattered than those by the GLUE method; (2) using a higher threshold value ({$>$}0.8) GLUE results in very similar estimates of parameter and model uncertainty as does the Bayesian method; and (3) GLUE is sensitive to the threshold value used to select behavioral parameter sets and lower threshold values resulting in a wider uncertainty interval of the posterior distribution of parameters, and a wider confidence interval of model uncertainty. More study is needed to generalize the findings of the present study.},

Finite volume method (FVM) is applied to numerically solve the governing equations of fluid flow. The velocity magnitude, tangential velocity, transverse velocity and Reynolds stresses are calculated for various flow conditions. Good agreement between the simulated and available laboratory measurements was obtained, indicating that the RSM can accurately predict the complicated flow phenomenon. Comparison of the calculated secondary currents of four cases (one being inbank flow and other three being overbank flow) with different water depths reveals that (i) the inbank flow exhibits different flow behaviors from that of the overbank flow does and (ii) the water depth has significant effects on the magnitude and direction of secondary currents.

  abstract = {Turbidity currents may be a relevant lever to manage the accumulation of fine sediments in reservoirs. In this paper, we propose to show how two different numerical codes simulate the propagation of turbidity currents. Telemac 3D and Ansys CFX 17.1 solver were chosen as they are commonly used by many research and engineering teams. The simulations are performed on two configurations. The first case aims at modeling the plunging of a turbidity current. The second model is validated based on an experimental work performed at EPFL. The latter consisted on testing turbidity current venting as a solution to manage reservoir sedimentation. A long and narrow flume was used to simulate the reservoir where a turbidity current was triggered. The advantages and limits of both approaches are discussed in order to supply guidelines for the modeling of turbidity currents in real reservoirs.},

  abstract = {Most analytical models of the flow and bed topography in sinuous channels include the assumption that the secondary flow is locally adapted to channel curvature. Recently, Kitanidis and Kennedy (1984) and Ikeda and Nishimura (1986) have, however, established the existence of a phase lag between the two, induced by inertia, i.e., downstream convective acceleration of the secondary flow. The analysis of Ikeda and Nishimura (1986), nevertheless, includes an unverified assumption. Herein a more rigorous derivation of the effect is obtained with a minimum of assumptions. The predicted lag appears to be sufficiently small to warrant neglect in natural channels. The theory predicts much higher values in many experimental channels, in agreement with data. The reason for this is that a scaled dimensionless meander wave number r, found to be order-one in natural channels, is found to be an order of magnitude higher in many laboratory meandering flumes.},

A small perturbation approach is used to linearize the governing equations. The well-known "moment method," commonly used to solve the concentration distributions, is then used to obtain an approximate.solution. This makes it possible to take into account the convective transport of primary flow momentum by the secondary flow. This oft-neglected influence of the secondary flow is shown to be an important cause of the redistribution of the primary flow velocity. The model, when tested with laboratory data, gives substantially better results than several previous models.},

Suspended sediments and bedload have been sampled during afforestation in the Monachyle and clear-felling in the Kirkton catchments. Rating equations showed that most of the increase in suspended sediment was in the low flow ranges and the scatter in the data points also increased. Total sediment yields increased to 312\% of former levels in the Monachyle and 818\% in the Kirkton. These increases are probably due to a combined effect of the forestry land-use changes and increased precipitation. Pre-land-use change relationships have been applied to the later years to remove the effects of the precipitation increase. This has shown that yields caused by the forestry land-use changes were 121\% (Monachyle) and 595\% (Kirkton) of former levels.},

It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application.},

  abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

  abstract = {A systematic study of a two-dimensional viscous flow through the straight-diverging-straight (SDS) channel defined by two straight-walled sections of different widths and a divergent section in-between is presented here. It has the plane Poiseuille flow (PPF) and the symmetric sudden expansion flow as the limiting cases. The topology of steady laminar flows and its bifurcations are characterized in the multi-parametric space formed by the divergence angle, the expansion ratio, and the Reynolds number. Three different steady flow regimes with two symmetric zones of recirculation, two asymmetric zones of recirculation, and the one with an additional third recirculation zone are observed with increasing Reynolds number. Modal stability analysis shows that the asymmetric flows remain stable at least up to Re = 300, regardless of the divergence angle and expansion ratio. Nonmodal stability analyses are applied to SDS flows in the three topology regimes. A remarkable potential for transient amplification due to the Orr mechanism is found even for relatively low Reynolds numbers, which is related to the flow topology. The optimal energy amplification grows exponentially with the Reynolds number, as opposed to the substantially weaker Re2 scaling known for the lift-up mechanism dominant for PPF. This scaling holds for all divergence angles and is further increased by the expansion ratio, resulting in energy amplifications Gmax {$\sim$} 104 for Reynolds numbers as low as Re {$\sim$} 300. Present results suggest that the sub-critical transition due to transient growth is the most likely scenario for SDS flows at low Reynolds numbers.},

Four governing equations (flow rate, resistance to flow, secondary flow, and particle mobility) are solved to analytically define the downstream hydraulic geometry of noncohesive alluvial channels as a function of water discharge, sediment size, Shields number, and streamline deviation angle. The exponents of hydraulic geometry relationships change with relative submergence. Four exponent diagrams illustrate the good agreement with several empirical regime equations found in the literature. The analytical formulations were tested with a comprehensive data set consisting of 835 field channels and 45 laboratory channels. The data set covers a wide range of flow conditions from meandering to braided, sand-bed and gravel-bed rivers with flow depths and channel widths varying by four orders of magnitude. Figures illustrate the results of the three-part analysis consisting of calibration, verification, and validation of the proposed hydraulic geometry equations. Field and laboratory observations are in very good agreement with the calculations of flow depth, channel width, mean flow velocity, and friction slope.},

The extensive field data set includes near-bed sediment transport measurements by size fractions from 0.125 to 32 mm using a Helley-Smith sampler.

However, these approaches neglect any uncertainties in the model inputs, which might play a substantial role. The objective of this research is to include uncertainties in sediment transport model inputs and evaluate their contributions to the overall uncertainty in the model predictions. To accomplish this goal, simple error models are developed for the input data and integrated into an existing Bayesian method. Five types of input data are considered: input discharges, rating curves, vertical and horizontal distances in cross-sections, and benchmark elevations that define the longitudinal profile of the reach. The input errors are modeled using Gaussian distributions, and the means and standard deviations are treated as uncertain parameters that are estimated within the Bayesian framework. The Bayesian approach is coupled to the Sedimentation and River Hydraulics-One Dimension (SRH1D) model and used to simulate a 23-km reach of the Tachia River in Taiwan. When input uncertainties are included, the prediction ranges change substantially and cover more of the available observations, which suggests the uncertainty is better represented when input errors are considered. The results also indicate that the errors in the benchmark elevations have the largest impact on the uncertainty of the predictions among those considered.},

  abstract = {We present a performance assessment of the European Integrated Carbon Observing System (ICOS) atmospheric network for constraining European biogenic CO2 fluxes (hereafter net ecosystem exchange, NEE). The performance of the network is assessed in terms of uncertainty in the fluxes, using a state-of-the-art mesoscale variational atmospheric inversion system assimilating hourly averages of atmospheric data to solve for NEE at 6 h and 0.5{\textdegree} resolution. The performance of the ICOS atmospheric network is also assessed in terms of uncertainty reduction compared to typical uncertainties in the flux estimates from ecosystem models, which are used as prior information by the inversion. The uncertainty in inverted fluxes is computed for two typical periods representative of northern summer and winter conditions in July and in December 2007, respectively. These computations are based on a observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) framework. We analyzed the uncertainty in a 2-week-mean NEE as a function of the spatial scale with a focus on the model native grid scale (0.5{\textdegree}), the country scale and the European scale (including western Russia and Turkey). Several network configurations, going from 23 to 66 sites, and different configurations of the prior uncertainties and atmospheric model transport errors are tested in order to assess and compare the improvements that can be expected in the future from the extension of the network, from improved prior information or transport models. Assimilating data from 23 sites (a network comparable to present-day capability) with errors estimated from the present prior information and transport models, the uncertainty reduction on a 2-week-mean NEE should range between 20 and 50 \% for 0.5{\textdegree} resolution grid cells in the best sampled area encompassing eastern France and western Germany. At the European scale, the prior uncertainty in a 2-week-mean NEE is reduced by 50 \% (66 \%), down to {\textasciitilde} 43 Tg C month-1 (26 Tg C month-1) in July (December). Using a larger network of 66 stations, the prior uncertainty of NEE is reduced by the inversion by 64 \% (down to {\textasciitilde} 33 Tg C month-1) in July and by 79 \% (down to {\textasciitilde} 15 Tg C month-1) in December. When the results are integrated over the well-observed western European domain, the uncertainty reduction shows no seasonal variability. The effect of decreasing the correlation length of the prior uncertainty, or of reducing the transport model errors compared to their present configuration (when conducting real-data inversion cases) can be larger than that of the extension of the measurement network in areas where the 23 station observation network is the densest. We show that with a configuration of the ICOS atmospheric network containing 66 sites that can be expected on the long-term, the uncertainties in a 2-week-mean NEE will be reduced by up to 50{\textendash}80 \% for countries like Finland, Germany, France and Spain, which could significantly improvement (and at least a high complementarity to) our knowledge of NEE derived from biomass and soil carbon inventories at multi-annual scales.},

However, its computational efficiency deteriorates significantly when the amount of hydrometeorological data increases. In recent years, the rise of heterogeneous parallel computing has brought hope for the acceleration of hydrological model calibration. This study proposed a parallel SCE-UA method and applied it to the calibration of a watershed rainfall{\textendash}runoff model, the Xinanjiang model. The parallel method was implemented on heterogeneous computing systems using OpenMP and CUDA. Performance testing and sensitivity analysis were carried out to verify its correctness and efficiency. Comparison results indicated that heterogeneous parallel computing-accelerated SCE-UA converged much more quickly than the original serial version and possessed satisfactory accuracy and stability for the task of fast hydrological model calibration.},

In this paper, an application of the Metropolis algorithm, a general Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling method, for the calibration of a four-parameter lumped urban stormwater quality model is presented. Unlike traditional optimisation approaches, the Metropolis algorithm identifies not only a ``best parameter set'', but a probability distribution of parameters according to measured data. The studied model includes classical formulations for the pollutant accumulation during dry weather period and their washoff during a rainfall event. Results indicate mathematical shortcomings in the pollutant accumulation formulation used.},

An Ultrasonic Doppler Velocity Profiler (UVP) and LSPIV techniques were used for verification and validation of the numerical simulations. The velocities measured by means of UVP allowed an instantaneous measurement of the 1D velocity profile over the whole flow depth. The turbulence large-scale structures and jet expansion in the basin have been determined based on UVP, LSPIV and numerical simulations. Vertical velocity distributions were defined to study the vertical velocity effect. UVP measurements confirm 2D flow map in shallow reservoir. LSPIV has potential to measure low velocities.

The geometry shape factor is an important factor to predict the flow and sediment deposition in the reservoir. The evolution of trap efficiency has an increasing or decreasing effect according to the geometry shape factor and flow patterns. The channel formed during flushing attracts the jet and stabilizes the flow structures over the entire reservoir. Empirical formulas to describe the relationship between the geometry shape factor and sediment trap efficiency as well as flushing efficiency were developed.},

The empirical relationships in HEC-18 are based on cohesionless soils and have been proven to be overly conservative cohesive soils. To incorporate the scour behavior of cohesive soils in the design manual, the Federal Highway Administration recently developed a scour prediction model for cohesive soil. However, the new model is valid for a very narrow range of cohesive soils, focusing mainly low plastic silts and clays. The objective of this study was to determine significant soil properties that affect the critical shear stress (exerted by the flowing water on soils) for the onset of erosion using a broader spectrum of cohesive soils. A total of 71 soil samples from 27 bridge sites were used for this study. Erosion testing was performed in the Erosion Function Apparatus and soil properties were measured in the field and laboratory for obtaining different variables. Among the various soil properties, percent fines, liquid limit, and electrical resistivity were found to be statistically significant variables for predicting the critical shear stress. For the 71 samples used in this study, liquid limit varied between 26 to 80, plasticity index between 3 to 52, and percent fines between 11 to 100. Therefore, the variables that were found statistically significant in this study can be utilized to build a comprehensive model for critical shear stress, applicable for a broader range of cohesive soils.},

The effect of these channel geometric parameters on the flow and channel morphological characteristics is obvious. Therefore, it is important to characterize the difference in the flow structures and channel evolution processes for effective planning and implementation of bank erosion control measures. In the current study, we tried to investigate the variation in channel evolution and three-dimensional flow characteristics through 3-dimensional simulation. The flow pattern and locations of the maximum erosion-deposition zones indicated that the lower sinuosity channel are likely to translate or migrate downstream whereas higher sinuosity channels are more likely to expand laterally increasing the amplitude. Cross-stream variability of velocity increased with bend curvature and was particularly greater at the entry and exit of the bend. Secondary circulation was dominant at the apex of the bend which was redistributed by the groynes.},

In this study, detailed hydrographic surveys with Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) were conducted at an active erodible river bend to measure suspended load, velocity, bathymetric profile and characteristics of the bed material. Study indicates the presence of multi-thread flow in the channel bend. Local variation of sediment transport is primarily controlled by active bank erosion, land spur and sand bar formation. Vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration follows a power function with normalized depth. Average bed-material concentration at the reach level is computed from observed sediment profiles, and is compared against various sediment transport functions. Results show that the sediment transport function suggested by Yang gives better predictions for this reach. Transverse bed slopes at critical survey transects were computed from the bathymetric data and evaluated with analytical approaches. Out of three analytical approaches used, Odgaard's approach estimates the bed slopes fairly close to the observed one. These two functions are suitable in the Brahmaputra river for further morphological studies.},

Here, yield traits in a range of key bioenergy crops are reviewed, from which several targets for future improvement can be identified. Some are already the focus of genetically modified (GM) and non-GM approaches. However, the efficient growth strategies of perennial bioenergy crops rely on newly assimilated and recycled carbon and remobilized nitrogen in a continually shifting balance between sources and sinks. This balance is affected by biotic (e.g. pest, disease) and abiotic (e.g. drought) stresses. Future research should focus on three main challenges: changing (photo)thermal time sensitivity to lengthen the growing season without risking frost damage or limiting remobilization of nutritional elements following senescence; increasing aboveground biomass without depleting belowground reserves required for next year's growth and thus without increasing the requirement for nutrient applications; and increasing aboveground biomass without increasing water use.

  abstract = {Flow within an alluvial channel bend is significantly affected by channel geometry, including curvature ratio (bend radius/channel width, R=B) and aspect ratio (channel width/flow depth, B=H). High curvature bends (R=B {$\leq$} 3) can experience substantially more erosion than milder curvature bends. This study employs a three-dimensional Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model to investigate the effects of curvature ratio and aspect ratio on bend flow with respect to a high curvature (R=B {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.5) base case in a 135{\textdegree} bend. Experimental data are used to validate the RANS model predictions for the high curvature base case with a flat bed (FB) and an equilibrium deformed bed (DB). Five curvature ratios (1.5, 3, 5, 8, and 10) and four aspect ratios (5.00, 6.67, 9.09, and 12.50) are investigated. Results show that a decrease in R=B or B=H for the FB cases results in a strong increase in total circulation of the regions associated with the primary cell of cross-stream circulation ({$\Gamma$}{\th}), an increase in maximum bed shear stress, and an increase in the contribution of the cross-stream component to the total magnitude of bed shear stress. The values of R=B and B=H also affect the structure of the cross-stream flow. The primary cell of cross-stream circulation splits into two clockwise-rotating cells at low R=B values and the cell situated closer to the inner wall induces strong ejections of vorticity. At high R=B values, a secondary counter-clockwise rotating cell forms at the outer bank. At lower B=H values, the primary cell splits into two clockwise-rotating cells. This study shows that the position and size of regions of high bed shear stress, and thus the capacity of the flow to entrain sediment, depend strongly on bend curvature.

In this model, the depth-averaged unsteady water flow equations along with the sediment continuity equation are solved by using the Beam and Warming alternating-direction implicit scheme. Unlike the present models based on Cartesian or cylindrical coordinate systems and steady flow equations, a body-fitted coordinate system and unsteady flow equations are used so that unsteady effects and natural channels may be modeled accurately. The effective stresses associated with the flow equations are modeled by using a constant eddyviscosity approach. This study is restricted to beds of uniform particles, i.e., armoring and grain-sorting effects are neglected. To verify the model, the computed results are compared with the data measured in 140{\textdegree} and 180{\textdegree} curved laboratory flumes with straight reaches up- and downstream of the bend. The model predictions agree better with the measured data than those obtained by previous numerical models. The model is used to investigate the process of evolution and stability of bed deformation in circular bends.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the impact of flow structure of different discharges on meander point bar morphology. We carried out mobile and terrestrial laser scanning campaigns before and after a flood on two sandy-bed point bars. Between the scans, the flow structure was examined using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler at three flow stages. The results indicated that a meander point bar both affects and in turn, is itself modified by the flow at different discharges. The lower flow stages also have a significant effect on point bar morphology, especially on deposition over the bar head. Secondary circulation is responsible for scroll bar formation on the point bar margin beyond the apex. Flow separation at the inner bank, by contrast, does not require secondary circulation, but is dependent on flow depth over the point bar. A sudden increase in depth beyond the point bar top causes decreased stream power over the bar tail. The flow separation and decreased stream power cause a slow flow zone and net deposition over point bar tail. The backwater effect, if evident, may strengthen the process. Thus, filling over the bar tail seems generic for point bars and independent on secondary flow. Chutes and chute bars, scroll bars, bar head filling and bar platform filling, by contrast, require special fluvio-morphological circumstances discussed in this paper. Whilst this paper confirms that the three-dimensional flow structure has a major effect on point bar morphology, the flow structure seems to depend on how the point bar affects the flow trajectory which, in turn, depends upon the flow stage. Finally, the shape of the bend and the grain size distribution control the impacts of the flow structure, leading to divergent morphologies of point bars with certain generic features.

Despite progress in the description of physical processes, the degree of accuracy of morphodynamic model results remains difficult to assess and are also less than for hydrodynamics alone. In this paper, three different 2D morphodynamic systems have been applied to simulate a complex hydrodynamic and morphodynamic situation. These model systems were validated using data of sediment sorting and bed deformation conducted in a 180◦ channel bend under unsteady-flow conditions. The calculations obtained by each modeling system were compared with the available observed data. The simulated results showed that all applied morphodynamic models could precisely calculate the bed level changes and the areas of deposition and scour. However, the models are not efficient enough to predict the distribution of the mean grain size in the channel bend.},

  address = {{Munich, Germany}},
  abstract = {One of the weakest aspects of hydromorphological models is the use of empirical formulae for calculating sediment transport rates, which are of limited generality. In many cases, unreasonable morphological changes are predicted and the results of the different formulae often strongly vary. The reasons arise from the complexity of the interaction between flow and sediment transport, and in the limitations of the nonlinear regression applied in these methods. In contrast to most traditional empirical methods, which need prior knowledge about the nature of the relationships within the data, the data-driven models (e.g. Artificial Neural Networks) learn from the data examples presented to them in order to capture the subtle functional relationships between the data. This can be determined even if the underlying relationships are unknown or the physical meaning is difficult to explain. The main objective of this study is to develop optimal Artificial Neural Network models (ANNs), able to be integrated into a hydromorphological model system and adequately predict the morphological changes in alluvial channels under different flow conditions. To achieve this aim, the open source finite element system, TELEMAC-MASCARET, was applied to simulate different complex hydrodynamic and morphodynamic situations. The calibrated results were then used as input-data in ANN to obtain ANN-based approximators for the new proposed schemes of hydromorphodynamic-model system. In the first scheme, 2 or 3 ANN models might be utilized for hydrodynamic calculations. At each time step, the hydrodynamic variables including velocity field and water depth were transferred into the morphodynamic model (ANN-based approximator), which then sent back the updated bed elevation to the hydrodynamic model. In the second scheme, only one ANN based approximator model was integrated into the sediment transport model SISYPHE while the TELEMAC-2D/3D remained unchanged for hydrodynamic calculations. The time-step of morphodynamic part (ANN-based approximator) was much larger than the time step of TELEMAC-2D/3D and during the flow computation, the bed level was assumed to stay constant. The novelty of the proposed schemes is that they reduce the computation costs significantly in the prediction of both hydrodynamic and morphodynamic variables. To evaluate the prediction qualities of the proposed models, a comparative study evaluating the errors associated with the model was carried out. A statistical parameter included in this study was the measurement of goodness-of-fit between the estimated bed change and TELEMAC simulation.},

In undisturbed populations, adult straying is a fundamental component of metapopulation biology, facilitating genetic resilience, demographic stability, recolonization, and range expansion into unexploited habitats. Unfortunately, salmonid hatcheries and other human actions worldwide have affected straying in ways that can negatively affect wild populations through competitive interactions, reduced productivity and resiliency, hybridization and domestication effects, and outbreeding depression. Reduced adult straying is therefore an objective for many managed populations. Currently, there is considerable uncertainty about the range of `natural' stray rates and about which mechanisms precipitate straying in either wild or human-influenced fish. Research in several disciplines indicates that adult straying is affected by endocrine physiology and neurological processes in juveniles, incomplete or interrupted imprinting during rearing and emigration, and by complex interactions among adult maturation processes, reproductive behaviors, olfactory memory, environmental conditions during migration, and senescence physiology. Reported salmonid stray rates indicate that the behavior varies among species, among life-history types, and among populations within species. Most strays enter sites near natal areas, but long-distance straying also occurs, especially in hatchery populations that were outplanted or transported as juveniles. A majority of past studies has estimated straying as demographic losses from donor populations, but some have estimated straying into recipient populations. Most recipient-based estimates have substantiated concerns that wild populations are vulnerable to swamping by abundant hatchery and farm-raised strays.},

  abstract = {Stream channel development in forested areas is profoundly influenced by large organic debris (logs, limbs and rootwads greater than 10 cm in diameter) in the channels. In low gradient meandering streams large organic debris enters the channel through bank erosion, mass wasting, blowdown, and collapse of trees due to ice loading. In small streams large organic debris may locally influence channel morphology and sediment transport processes because the stream may not have the competency to redistribute the debris. In larger streams flowing water may move large organic debris, concentrating it into distinct accumulations (debris jams). Organic debris may greatly affect channel form and process by: increasing or decreasing stability of stream banks; influencing development of midchannel bars and short braided reaches; and facilitating, with other favourable circumstances, development of meander cutoffs. In steep gradient mountain streams organic debris may enter the channel by all the processes mentioned for low gradient streams. In addition, considerable debris may also enter the channel by way of debris avalanches or debris torrents. In small to intermediate size mountain streams with steep valley walls and little or no floodplain or flat valley floor, the effects of large organic debris on the fluvial processes and channel form may be very significant. Debris jams may locally accelerate or retard channel bed and bank erosion and/or deposition; create sites for significant sediment storage; and produce a stepped channel profile, herein referred to as `organic stepping', which provides for variable channel morphology and flow conditions. The effect of live or dead trees anchored by rootwads into the stream bank may not only greatly retard bank erosion but also influence channel width and the development of small scour holes along the channel beneath tree roots. Once trees fall into the stream, their influence on the channel form and process may be quite different than when they were defending the banks, and, depending on the size of the debris, size of the stream, and many other factors, their effects range from insignificant to very important.},

  abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

  abstract = {Vertical mixing plays a major role in functioning of seasonally stratified aquatic systems. In this study, we employ a 1-D stratification model and a 9 year forcing data set to simulate the thermal dynamics in a large, but shallow reservoir that regularly displays a polymictic character with complete mixing events during summer. Such mixing dynamics is typical for many water bodies in the temperate zone having an intermediate depth. In many cases summer-mixing events were documented to induce severe water quality deteriorations (e.g., cyanobacterial blooms). We examined and quantified the response of summer-mixing behavior to combinations of hydrological regimes, i.e., water level fluctuations and withdrawal depth, and changes in meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature and wind speed. According to our findings: (i) increasing summer air temperatures considerably increase the resistance of the water column against mixing; (ii) while the combination of maintenance of a high and constant water depth and implementation of epilimnetic discharge results in almost complete resistance to mixing, their individual effects are also substantial, being roughly comparable to the effects of 4{\textendash}6 K increase in air temperatures; (iii) wind is a critical variable, 30\% increase of which can compensate up to 5.5 K increase in air temperatures; and (iv) effects of changes in air temperature, wind speed, and water depth are inter-dependent, as indicated by enhanced importance of wind and temperature in response to decreasing water depth, as well as reduced importance of depth in response to decreasing wind speed and increasing temperature.},

  abstract = {When the flows in natural or man made channel sections exceed the main channel depth, the adjoining floodplains become inundated and carry part of the river discharge. Due to different hydraulic conditions prevailing in the river and floodplain of a compound channel, the mean velocity in the main channel and in the floodplain are different. This leads to the transfer of momentum between the main channd water and that of the floodplain making the flow structure more complex. Reliable estimates of discharge capacity and its distribution for a compound channel are essential for the design, operation, and maintenance of open channels, more importantly for the prediction of flood and flood protection measures. Results of some experiments concerning the velocity and flow distribution in meandering and straight compound channels are presented. Discharge distribution in such compound channels is strongly dependant on the interaction between flow in the main channel and that in the floodplain. The influence of the geometry on velocity, flow distribution, and the different functional relationships are obtained. Dimensionless parameters are used to form equations representing the flow distribution between main channel and flood plain subsections. A set of meandering and straight compound sections of rectangular and trapezoidal cross section is studied with width ratio varying between 2 to 16.08. The equations agree well with experimental discharge data. Using the proposed area method, the error between the measured and calculated discharge distribution for the meandering and straight compound sections is found to be the minimum when compared with that using other investigators.},

  abstract = {During uniform flow in an open channel the resistance is dependent on a number of flow and geometrical parameters. The usual practice in one dimensional flow analysis is to select an appropriate value of roughness coefficient for evaluating the carrying capacity of natural channel. This value of roughness is taken as uniform for the entire surface and for all depths of flow. The resistance coefficients for meandering channels are found to vary with flow depths, aspect ratio, slope and sinuosity and are all linked to the stage-discharge relationships. Although much research has been done on Manning's n for straight channels,a last word has not been spoken on the roughness values for meandering channels. An investigation concerning the variation of roughness coefficients for meandering channels with slope, sinuosity and geometry are presented. The loss of energy in terms of Darcy-Weisbach coefficient f are evaluated. A simple equation for roughness coefficient based on dimensional analysis is modeled and tested with the recent experimental data. The method gives discharge results that are quite comparable to that of the observed values as well as with other published data.},

For flow field simulation, the Reynolds-averaged Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations are solved numerically, without reliance on the assumption of hydrostatic pressure distribution, in a curvilinear nonorthogonal coordinate system. Turbulence closure is provided by either a low-Reynolds number k - ␻ turbulence model or the standard k - ␧ turbulence model, both of which apply a Boussinesq eddy viscosity. The sediment concentration distribution is obtained using the convectiondiffusion equation and the sediment continuity equation is applied to calculate channel bed evolution, based on consideration of both bed load and suspended sediment load. The governing equations are solved in a collocated grid system. Experimental data obtained from a laboratory study of flow in an S-shaped channel are utilized to check the accuracy of the model's hydrodynamic computations. Also, data from a different laboratory study, of equilibrium bed morphology associated with flow through 90{\textdegree} and 135{\textdegree} channel bends, are used to validate the model's simulated bed evolution. The numerically-modeled fluid and sediment transportation show generally good agreement with the measured data. The calculated results with both turbulence models show that the low-Reynolds k - ␻ model better predicts flow and sediment transport through channel bends than the standard k - ␧ model.},

  abstract = {Building simulation tools have been widely used for performance assessment. However, many studies [1] have reported that a performance gap exists between the reality and simulation output, mainly caused by unknown simulation inputs. Therefore, model calibration needs to be introduced. Calibration attempts can fail for the following reasons: coarse initial simulation model, long sampling time, uncertainty in the model, and sensor errors. The aim of this paper is to address the abovementioned issues. For this study, an existing office building was selected and two calibration approaches were presented: deterministic vs. stochastic. For stochastic calibration, a Gaussian Process Emulator (GPE) was introduced as a surrogate of the EnergyPlus model. The stochastically calibrated model performs better than the deterministically calibrated model. It is concluded in the paper that (1) the calibration quality is influenced by the degree of the details of the initial model, (2) the accumulated measured data under a sampling time of up to one day (e.g. gas energy consumption) might be unsuitable for calibration work due to the lack of `time-series trend', and (3) the calibration quality is also influenced by sensor errors and further calibration needs to take these into account.},

The expected environmental improvements are an improvement in flood control, an increase in the water supply for environmental improvement, an increase in the water supply for the instream flow requirement, and the abatement of air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. This article aims to value the four improvements by applying a choice experiment. For the purpose of reflecting the preference heterogeneity, by investigating the choice experiment data gathered from a survey of 1000 people, a Bayesian estimation of a mixed logit model is employed. The environmental benefits of a 1\% improvement in flood control, a 1\% increase in the water supply for environmental improvement, a 1\% increase in the water supply for the instream flow requirement, and a 1\% abatement of air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to be KRW 71 (USD 0.06), 51 (0.05), 28 (0.03), and 77 (0.07), respectively, per household per year. The expected improvements for the four attributes are 25.2\%, 17.7\%, 17.7\%, and 1.0\%, respectively. Thus, the expected environmental benefits are worth KRW 3265 (USD 2.96) per household per year and the national value amounts to KRW 63.74 billion (USD 57.77 million).},

For each sample 13 different physical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties were measured. Critical shear stress of erosion and erosion rate were quantified using an Erosion Measurement Device (EMD). Stepwise regression was used to find the variables most significantly correlated to critical shear stress and erosion rate, which led to the development of a new empirical equation to estimate the critical shear stress of cohesive soils.

This paper describes an holistic methodology, DRIFT (Downstream Response to Imposed Flow Transformation), for advising on environmental flows for rivers targetted for water-management activities. DRIFT's basic philosophy is that all major abiotic and biotic components constitute the ecosystem to be managed; and within that, the full spectrum of flows, and their temporal and spatial variability, constitute the flows to be managed. The methodology employs experienced scientists from the following biophysical disciplines: hydrology, hydraulics, fluvial geomorphology, sedimentology, chemistry, botany and zoology. Where there are subsistence users of the river, the following socio-economic disciplines are also employed: sociology, anthropology, water supply, public health, livestock health and resource economics. DRIFT is a structured process for combining data and knowledge from all the disciplines to produce flow-related scenarios for water managers to consider. It consists of four modules. In the first, or biophysical module, the river ecosystem is described and predictive capacity developed on how it would change with flow changes. In the second, or socio-economic module, links are described between riparian people who are subsistence users of river resources, the resources they use, and their health. The objective is to develop predictive capacity of how river changes would impact their lives. In the third module, scenarios are built of potential future flows and the impacts of these on the river and the riparian people. The fourth, or economic module, lists compensation and mitigation costs. DRIFT should run in parallel with two other exercises which are external to it: a macro-economic assessment of the wider implications of each scenario, and a Public Participation Process whereby people other than subsistence users can indicate the level of acceptability of each scenario. DRIFT has been developed in a semi-arid, developing region, where water-supply problems are pressing, and uncertainties about river-linked ecological and social processes high. The use of DRIFT in this context is discussed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This study summarises our development and application in developing countries of a process for assessing the ecological, social and economic costs and benefits of water-resource developments, as an aid to basin planning. 2. During 15 years of work in Africa and Asia, the process sequentially included the whole river ecosystem and the whole flow regime in the assessment; used a multidisciplinary team and a scenario-based approach that gave equal weighting to the ecological, social, resource-economic and macro-economic costs and benefits of development; quantified or semi-quantified the costs and benefits in data-poor situations, capturing expert opinion and local wisdom as well as data; recognised that the final allocation of water for ecosystem maintenance should be a societal choice of trade-offs between resource protection and development. 3. Flow assessments were increasingly done at the basin rather than project level and introduced the concept and practicality of Development Space as a tool to aid basin planning. 4. Later assessments included valuation of regulating, cultural and provisioning services provided by rivers as part of the cost-benefit analysis. 5. Implementation of managed flows as outlined above is a complex and long-term process that should include a number of major steps, from development of the appropriate legislation to monitoring of management decisions and adaptive management. Country or region-wide implementation at this scale could well take one to two decades, even where the political will and technical skills exist. 6. We conclude by offering eight principles that we believe would promote genuinely sustainable use of rivers.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract = {The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is the most widely used and misused prediction equation in the world. Although it was designed to predict long-term average annual soil loss, it has the capacity to predict event soil losses reasonably well at some geographic locations and not well at others. Its lack of capacity to predict event erosion is highly influenced by the fact the event rainfall{\textendash}runoff factor used in the USLE and its revisions (RUSLE, RUSLE2) does not consider runoff explicitly. While including direct consideration of runoff in the event rainfall{\textendash}runoff factor improves the capacity to predict event erosion when runoff is measured, that capacity is reduced by inaccurate runoff prediction methods. Even so, the predictions may be better than when the traditional event rainfall{\textendash}runoff factor is used if the rainfall{\textendash}runoff model used to predict runoff works reasonably well. Direct consideration of runoff in the rainfall{\textendash}runoff factor may improve the ability of the model to account for seasonal effects. It also enhances the ability of the model to account for the spatial variations in soil loss on hillslopes which result from spatial variations in soil and vegetation. However, the USLE model will not provide a capacity to account for deposition taking place on concave hillslopes unless it is coupled with an appropriate sediment transport model, as in done in RUSLE2. Changing the basis of the event rainfall{\textendash}runoff factor has consequences on a number of the other factors used in the model, in particular new values of the soil erodibility factor need to be determined. Using runoff values from cropped areas is necessary to account for differences in infiltration capacities between vegetated and tilled bare fallow areas, but requires re-evaluation of the crop factors.},

  abstract = {Hutchinson and L{\"o}ffler's (1956) classification of lakes based on the seasonal thermal mixing regime has become a cornerstone of any analysis of lakes as elements of the earth surface. Until now however the lake classification has lacked a physically sound quantitative criterion distinguishing between two fundamental lake types: thermally stratified during a large portion of the year (mono- and dimictic) and predominantly mixed to the bottom (polymictic). Using the mechanistic balance between potential and kinetic energy we review the different formulations of the Richardson number to derive a generalized scaling for seasonal stratification in a closed lake basin. The scaling parameter is the critical mean basin depth, Hcrit, that delineates lakes that mix regularly from those that stratify seasonally based on lake water transparency, lake length, and an annual mean estimate for the Monin-Obukhov length. We validate the scaling on available data of lakes worldwide using logistic regression. The scaling criterion consistently described the mixing regime significantly better than either the conventional unbounded basin scaling or a simple depth threshold. Thus, the generalized scaling is universal for freshwater lakes and allows the seasonal mixing regime to be estimated without numerically solving the heat transport equations.},

The latter is thereby based on a section wise definition and a coarser temporal resolution of the roughness coefficients update. Main findings are that the internal roughness adaption causes almost no drawback regarding computing time or leads to instabilities. The external approach shows a significant speed up, mainly due to the fact that it requires to be embedded in a framework for tem-poral decomposition of the complete simulation period. The sediment transport rates show slightly deviating results.}

The entrainment and deposition depth of the sediment depend on dune trough levels below the average bed level and therefore on the dune height. As bedload sediment transport depends partly on grain size, it will be dependent upon the relict vertical sorting left in the bed by former discharge waves. The vertical sorting is created by sorting in grain flows on the lee side of dunes and by gravel lag formation in the dune troughs. Based on these principles, a simple reach-representative process model is developed for the prediction of bed sediment reworking, vertical sorting and deposition by dunes. The model is applied to two successive discharge waves of different magnitude, and predicts qualitatively the same vertical sorting characteristics as observed in the vibracores from the River Rhine (The Netherlands) after two successive discharge waves. The effect of the sorting on the sediment transport, and how to include this feedback in future models, is discussed.},

The balance between floodplain formation and destruction determines the width and pattern of channels. Floodplain structure affects the style and rate of channel avulsion once aggradation takes place. Downstream fining of bed sediment and the sediment balance of fines in the pores of the bed sediment provide the `template' or sediment boundary conditions, from which sorting at smaller scales leads to the formation of distinct channel patterns. Bar patterns provide the template of bank erosion and formation as well as the dynamics of the channel network through bifurcation destabilization.

Spectral and functional characteristics of photosynthetic membranes revealed numerous similarities of the effects of {$\alpha$}-particles and space flight, which both interrupted excitation energy transfer from phycobilisomes to the photosystems and significantly reduced the concentration of phycobiliproteins. Although photosynthetic activity was severely suppressed, the effect was reversible, and the cells could rapidly recover from the stress. We suggest that the actual existence and the uncoupling of phycobilisomes may play a specific role not only in photo-, but also in radioprotection, which could be crucial for the early evolution of Life on Earth.},

Gas fluxes to the atmosphere ranged from -6.5 to 59.8 mmol m-2 d-1 for CO2 and from 0.08 to 1.02 mmol m-2 d-1 for CH4, and were uncorrelated with latitude or lake morphology. Seasonal trends include a buildup of CO2 and CH4 under ice during winter, and often an increased CO2 flux rate in August due to partial lake turnover. Nutrient fertilization experiments resulted in decreased CO2 release from a lake due to photosynthetic uptake, but no change in CO2 release from a river due to the much faster water renewal time. In lakes and rivers the groundwater input of dissolved CO2 and CH4 is supplemented by in-lake respiration of dissolved and particulate carbon washed in from land. The release of carbon from aquatic systems to the atmosphere averaged 24 g C m-2 y-1, and in coastal areas where up to 50\% of the surface area is water, this loss equals frac 1/5 to 1/2 of the net carbon accumulation rates estimated for tundra.},

The analysis showed that the bed load transport in ice-covered channels can be described by conventional relationships for the equivalent free-surface flow if the flow strength is expressed in terms of the bed shear stress.

  abstract = {Soil erosion is a major issue, causing the loss of topsoil and fertility in agricultural land in mountainous terrain. Estimation of soil erosion in Nepal is essential because of its agriculture-dependent economy (contributing 36\% to national GDP) and for preparing erosion control plans. The present study, for the first time, attempts to estimate the soil loss of Nepal through the application of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. In addition, it analyzes the effect of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) and slope ({$\beta$}) exposition on soil erosion. Nation-wide mean annual soil loss of Nepal is estimated at 25 t ha-1 yr-1 with a total of 369 million tonnes (mT) of potential soil loss. Soil erosion based on the physiographic region of the country shows that the Middle Mountains, High Mountains, High Himal, Chure, and Terai have mean erosion rates of 38.0, 32.0, 28.0, 7.0, and 0.1 t ha-1 yr-1. The soil erosion rate by basins showed that the annual erosions of the Karnali, Gandaki, Koshi, and Mahakali River basins are 135, 96, 79, and 15 mT, respectively. The mean soil erosion rate was significantly high (34 t ha-1 yr-1) for steep slopes ({$\beta$} {$>$} 26.8\%) and the low (3 t ha-1 yr-1) for gentle slopes ({$\beta$} {$<$} 5\%). Based on LULC, the mean erosion rate for barren land was the highest (40 t ha-1 yr-1), followed by agricultural land (29 t ha-1 yr-1), shrubland (25 t ha-1 yr-1), grassland (23 t ha-1 yr-1), and forests (22 t ha-1 yr-1). The entire area had been categorized into 6 erosion classes based on the erosion severity, and 11\% of the area was found to be under a very severe erosion risk ({$>$} 80 t ha-1 yr-1) that urgently required reducing the risk of erosion.},

  abstract = {Much of the recent literature on salmonid spawning gravels has been devoted to the search for a single statistic drawn or computed from the streambed particle size distribution to serve as an index of gravel quality. However, a natural gravel mixture cannot be fully described by any single statistic, because gravel requirements of salmonids differ with life stage, and thus the appropriate descriptor will vary with the functions of gravel at each life stage. To assess whether gravels are small enough to be moved by a given salmonid to construct a redd, the size of the framework gravels (the larger gravels that make up the structure of the deposit) is of interest, and the d50 or d84 of the study gravel (the sizes at which 50\% or 84\% of the sediments are finer) should be compared with the spawning gravel sizes observed for the species elsewhere. To assess whether the interstitial fine sediment content is so high as to interfere with incubation or emergence, the percentage of fine sediment of the potential spawning gravel should be adjusted for probable cleansing effects during redd construction, and then compared with rough standards drawn from laboratory and field studies of incubation and emergence success. An assessment should also consider that the fine sediment content of gravel can increase during incubation by infiltration, that the gravels may become armored over time, or that downwelling and upwelling currents may be inadequate. These considerations are incorporated in a nine-step, life-stage-specific assessment approach proposed here.},

  abstract = {By trapping sediment in reservoirs, dams interrupt the continuity of sediment transport through rivers, resulting in loss of reservoir storage and reduced usable life, and depriving downstream reaches of sediments essential for channel form and aquatic habitats. With the acceleration of new dam construction globally, these impacts are increasingly widespread. There are proven techniques to pass sediment through or around reservoirs, to preserve reservoir capacity and to minimize downstream impacts, but they are not applied in many situations where they would be effective. This paper summarizes collective experience from five continents in managing reservoir sediments and mitigating downstream sediment starvation. Where geometry is favorable it is often possible to bypass sediment around the reservoir, which avoids reservoir sedimentation and supplies sediment to downstream reaches with rates and timing similar to pre-dam conditions. Sluicing (or drawdown routing) permits sediment to be transported through the reservoir rapidly to avoid sedimentation during high flows; it requires relatively large capacity outlets. Drawdown flushing involves scouring and re-suspending sediment deposited in the reservoir and transporting it downstream through low-level gates in the dam; it works best in narrow reservoirs with steep longitudinal gradients and with flow velocities maintained above the threshold to transport sediment. Turbidity currents can often be vented through the dam, with the advantage that the reservoir need not be drawn down to pass sediment. In planning dams, we recommend that these sediment management approaches be utilized where possible to sustain reservoir capacity and minimize environmental impacts of dams.},

  abstract = {By social connectivity we refer to the communication and movement of people, goods, ideas, and culture along and across rivers, recognizing longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity, much as has been described for other rivers for hydrology and ecology. We focus on rivers as they pass through cities, and the relationships between these rivers and city dwellers. Historically, the most important longitudinal connectivity function of rivers was their role as major transport routes and the simplification of formerly complex, irregular banks and beds, into straight, uniform shipping channels has resulted in a loss of lateral and vertical connectivity, notably the quotidian uses such as fishing, washing clothes, water supply, swimming and other recreation. The scale of the river itself, and its scale in comparison to the scale of the city, largely determine the river's social function and the degree to which it influences city form. River width affects the perception of `closeness' of the other bank, ease of bridging the river, influence of the river on the city's street pattern, and type of waterfront uses that occur. Up to 15m wide, people can converse, whereas across rivers {\textasciitilde}50 to {\textasciitilde}200m wide, people are not recognizable but still clearly visible, instilling the banks with a `lively' atmosphere. At widths over {\textasciitilde}200m, people blur, yet moving vehicles and trees branches shaking in wind may still provide some dynamic elements to an otherwise static landscape composed of building facades. In exceptionally wide rivers, the city on the opposite bank is little more than a skyline, which often becomes a signature and symbol of regional identity. In contemplating how people use rivers, we can define a range of human activities in relation to height above the water (i.e., instream to banktop), a vertical dimension of human connectivity with rivers. Many uses occur on the top of the bank, such as quiet contemplation, walking, or cycling along a riverside trail, while others depend on contact with the water itself, such as wading, diving, and canoeing (which presupposes adequate water quality). Many of these relationships are illustrated by the challenge of reconnecting Cairo with the Nile.},

Many studies struggle with this complexity and either address only a part of this diversity or present data using discrete classifications for sizes, shapes, and densities. We argue that such classifications will never be fully satisfactory, as any definition using classes does not capture the essentially continuous nature of environmental microplastic. Therefore, we propose to simplify microplastics by fully defining them through a three-dimensional (3D) probability distribution, with size, shape, and density as dimensions. In addition to introducing the concept, we parametrize these probability distributions, using empirical data. This parametrization results in an approximate yet realistic representation of ``true'' environmental microplastic. This approach to simplifying microplastic could be applicable to exposure measurements, effect studies, and fate modeling. Furthermore, it allows for easy comparison between studies, irrespective of sampling or laboratory setup. We demonstrate how the 3D probability distribution of environmental versus ingested microplastic can be helpful in understanding the bioavailability of and exposure to microplastic. We argue that the concept of simplified microplastic will also be helpful in probabilistic risk modeling, which would greatly enhance our understanding of the risk that microplastics pose to the environment.},

The sediment erodibility was measured with an in situ flume on an intertidal flat. The hydrodynamics and suspended sediment concentrations above the flat were monitored from a measuring-bridge and in the tidal channel from a platform, using conventional instrumentation. The data from the flume, bridge and platform show that erosion resistance varied considerably from March until August 1996. A diatom bloom at the beginning of April appears to have resulted in an increase in resistance. Currents and waves were no longer able to resuspend sediment from the flat. This resulted in very low mean suspended sediment concentrations. The increase in erosion resistance did not only occur at the research site but on all flats in the Dollard. At the beginning of June, sediment erodibility increased and consequently the suspended sediment concentrations increased. This coincided with the disappearance of diatoms in May and with an increasing density of the amphipod Corophium volutator on the flat in June.

A diatom bloom at the beginning of April appears to have resulted in an increase in resistance. Currents and waves were no longer able to resuspend sediment from the flat. This resulted in very low mean suspended sediment concentrations. The increase in erosion resistance did not only occur at the research site but on all flats in the Dollard. At the beginning of June, sediment erodibility increased and consequently the suspended sediment concentrations increased. This coincided with the disappearance of diatoms in May and with an increasing density of the amphipod Corophium volutator on the flat in June.},

  abstract = {Information on forest structure is vital for sustainable forest management. Currently, airborne LiDAR remote sensing has been well established as an effective tool to characterize the structure of canopies and forest inventory variables. Radiometry and geometry are highly intertwined in LiDAR remote sensing of forest vegetation and phenology influences the geometric-optical properties of deciduous and evergreen trees causing seasonal variation in LiDAR observations. This variation may be considered as a nuisance or exploited in for example tree species identification. Airborne LiDAR data are also influenced by sensor functioning, acquisition settings, scan geometry and the atmosphere. Reliable estimation of subtle phenological effects calls for data in which the impact of the external factors is minimal. We experimented with such data and explored LIDAR waveforms (WFs) in boreal trees in winter, early summer and late summer. Our objectives were to i) assess the match of the multitemporal LiDAR data for observing true changes in vegetation; ii) quantify the influence of phenology in deciduous and evergreen trees; iii) study the effect of varying scan zenith angle (SZA) and canopy age on WF features in different phenostates; iv) assess the temporal feature correlation in individual living and dead standing trees. A WF-recording pulsed LiDAR sensor unit operating at the wavelength of 1550~nm was used in repeated acquisitions. WF attributes such as energy, peak amplitude and echo width were derived for each pulse and were localized vertically to crown, understory and ground components. Silver and downy birch, black alder, European aspen, Siberian larch, Scots pine, Norway spruce and dead standing spruce formed our strata. Results showed that phenology caused more variation in WF features of deciduous trees compared to evergreen conifers. Deciduous trees displayed substantial between-species variation that was linked with differences in branching pattern, leaf orientation and bark reflectance. Pine displayed a possible winter-early summer anomaly in canopy backscattering that may be linked with changes in foliage clumping or with the role of stamens in early summer trees. Trees displayed positive temporal correlation in WF features and correlations were the strongest in evergreen and deciduous conifers and decreased with time. SZA had minor influence on WF features whereas age exercised a strong effect on many features with parallel variation between species and phenostates. Structural changes following death, i.e. `aging' changed the geometric WF features of dead standing trees. Our results provide new insights for enhancing tree species identification by using WF LiDAR and for LiDAR time-series analysis of vegetation.},

Fluid density is implicitly required to be constant as the incompressibility condition, while the other terms are explicitly calculated. The Poisson equation of pressure is solved by the incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient method. Collapse of a water column is calculated using MPS. The effect of parameters in the models is investigated in test calculations. Good agreement with an experiment is obtained even if fragmentation and coalescence of the fluid take place.}

  abstract = {Deltas are cone-shaped deposits formed at the confluence of rivers with standing bodies of water. One of the most common stream morphologies associated with deltas is that of the sand-bed stream. Such streams usually carry significantly more mud as wash load than they do sand as bed material load. Deltas typically form so that the sand deposits fluvially in the river channel and avalanches into deeper water to create a prograding delta face. The remaining muddy river inflow often plunges over the steep delta face and continues flowing downslope as a bottom turbidity current. The mud carried into deep water by the underflow settles out on the bed of the lake or reservoir. A variety of numerical models dealing separately with either fluvial deposition or depositional turbidity currents have been proposed to date. The work reported here pertains to an integral, physically-based, moving boundary model of deltaic sedimentation in lakes and reservoirs that captures the co-evolution of the river-delta morphology and the associated deposits. The formulation unites fluvial and turbidity current morphodynamics in a single numerical model. The model is tested against the results of the two experiments described in a companion paper.}

For that, two open boundary conditions are defined, which are in the northern and southern parts of the Strait. Observed bathymetric, hydrographic, meteorological, and water-level data are used to set up the Delft3D-FLOW model. First, the sensitivities of the model parameters on the numerical model outputs are assessed using Parameter EStimation Tool (PEST) toolbox. Then, the model is calibrated based on the objective functions, focusing on the flow rates of the upper and lower layers. The salinity and temperature profiles of the strait are only used for model validation. The results show that the calibrated model outputs of the Istanbul Strait are reliable and consistent with the in situ measurements. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the spatial low-pass filter coefficient, horizontal eddy viscosity, Prandtl{\textendash}Schmidt number, slope in log{\textendash}log spectrum, and Manning roughness coefficient are most sensitive parameters affecting the flow rate performance of the model. The agreement between observed salinity profiles and simulated model outputs is promising, whereas the match between observed and simulated temperature profiles is weak, showing that the model can be improved, particularly for simulating the mixing layer.},

  abstract = {High-latitude aquatic ecosystems are responding to rapid climate warming. A longer ice-free season with higher water temperatures may accelerate somatic growth in lake ectotherms, leading to widespread ecological implications. In fish, rising temperatures are expected to boost rates of food intake and conversion, and predictions based on empirical relationships between temperature and growth suggest a substantial increase in fish growth rates during the last decades. Fish abundance negatively affects growth by limiting food availability. This field study addresses the effects of climate warming on growth of a subarctic population of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.) over nearly 40 years. Juvenile growth of 680 individuals of Arctic charr, was reconstructed by sclerochronological analysis using sagittal otoliths sampled annually from the early 1980s to 2016. Statistical modelling revealed a positive effect of water temperature, and a negative effect of abundance on somatic growth in juvenile individuals. Temperature dependence in growth was significant for average and fast-growing individuals across all investigated age classes. These findings suggest that, as temperatures rise, somatic growth of Arctic charr will increase in high latitude lakes. Climate warming will thus influence cold water fish life history and size-structured interactions, with important consequences for their populations and ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2023, Springer Nature Limited.}

However, there are many different calibration/uncertainty analysis algorithms, and each could be run with different objective functions. In this paper, we highlight the fact that each combination of optimization algorithm-objective functions may lead to a different set of optimum parameters, while having the same performance; this makes the interpretation of dominant hydrological processes in a watershed highly uncertain. We used three different optimization algorithms (SUFI-2, GLUE, and PSO), and eight different objective functions (R2, bR2, NSE, MNS, RSR, SSQR, KGE, and PBIAS) in a SWAT model to calibrate the monthly discharges in two watersheds in Iran. The results show that all three algorithms, using the same objective function, produced acceptable calibration results; however, with significantly different parameter ranges. Similarly, an algorithm using different objective functions also produced acceptable calibration results, but with different parameter ranges. The different calibrated parameter ranges consequently resulted in significantly different water resource estimates. Hence, the parameters and the outputs that they produce in a calibrated model are ``conditioned'' on the choices of the optimization algorithm and objective function. This adds another level of non-negligible uncertainty to watershed models, calling for more attention and investigation in this area.},

Soil erosion not only decreases agricultural productivity, but also reduces the water availability. In the current study, an effort to predict potential annual soil loss has been conducted. For the prediction, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) has been adopted in a Geographical Information System framework. The RUSLE factors were calculated (in the form of raster layers) for the nine major watersheds which cover the northern part of the Chania Prefecture. The R-factor was calculated from monthly and annual precipitation data. The K-factor was estimated using soil maps available from the Soil Geographical Data Base of Europe at a scale of 1:1,000,000. The LS-factor was calculated from a 30-m digital elevation model. The C-factor was calculated using Remote Sensing techniques. The P-factor in absence of data was set to 1. The results show that an extended part of the area is undergoing severe erosion. The mean annual soil loss is predicted up to *200 (t/ha year-1) for some watersheds showing extended erosion and demanding the attention of local administrators.},

The captured frames were analyzed by three different software (PIVlab, PTVlab, and KU-STIV) in order to estimate accurately the surface water velocity. These three software also represent three different image-based methodologies. Although there are differences among these three methods, the analysis produced similar trends for all. The velocity ranged between 0.02 and 3.98 m/s for PIVlab, 0.12 and 3.44 m/s for PTVlab, and 0.04 and 3.99 m/s for KU-STIV software. There were parts, especially in the existing vegetation, where differences were observed. Further applications will be examined in the same or different reaches, to study the parameters affecting the analysis. Finally, the image-based methods will be coupled with verification measurements by a current meter to produce more rigorous results.},

The optimization algorithm is based on a simple sediment transport model and it minimizes the necessary area of interventions.

Here we combine models with observations to show that regional snowmelt is a more important contributor to streamflow than glacier melt, that snowmelt magnitude and timing changed considerably during 1979{\textendash}2019 and that future snow meltwater supply may decrease drastically. The expected changes are strongly dependent on the degree of climate change, however, and large variations exist among river basins.

It results in a multiplicative update formula for the covariance matrix. We show that the exponential parameterization and the multiplicative update are compatible with all mechanisms of CMA-ES. The resulting algorithm, xCMA-ES, performs at least on par with plain CMA-ES. Its advantages show in particular with updates that actively decrease the sampling variance in specific directions, i.e., for active constraint handling.},

  abstract = {The origin of altruism is a fundamental problem in evolution, and the maintenance of biodiversity is a fundamental problem in ecology. These two problems combine with the fundamental microbiological question of whether it is always advantageous for a unicellular organism to grow as fast as possible, The common basis for these three themes is a trade-off between growth rate and growth yield, which in turn is based on irreversible thermodynamics. The trade-off creates an evolutionary alternative between two strategies: high growth yield at low growth rate versus high growth rate at low growth yield. High growth yield at low growth rate is a case of an altruistic strategy because it increases the fitness of the group by using resources economically at the cost of decreased fitness, or growth rate, of the individual. The group-beneficial behaviour is advantageous in the long term, whereas the high growth rate strategy is advantageous in the short term. Coexistence of species requires differences between their niches, and niche space is typically divided into four 'axes' (time, space, resources, predators). This neglects survival strategies based on cooperation, which extend the possibilities of coexistence, arguing for the inclusion of cooperation as the fifth 'axis'. Here, individual-based model simulations show that spatial structure, as in, for example, biofilms, is necessary for the origin and maintenance of this 'primitive' altruistic strategy and that the common belief that growth rate but not yield decides the outcome of competition is based on chemostat models and experiments. This evolutionary perspective on life in biofilms can explain long-known biofilm characteristics, such as the structural organization into microcolonies, the often-observed lack of mixing among microcolonies, and the shedding of single cells, as promoting the origin and maintenance of the altruistic strategy. Whereas biofilms enrich altruists, enrichment cultures, microbiology's paradigm for isolating bacteria into pure culture, select for highest growth rate.}

  abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.}

  abstract = {Within this study the two three-dimensional numerical models SSIIM 1 and SSIIM 2 are used to simulate a physical experiment of a reservoir flushing with partial drawdown of the water level. During the setup of the numerical model, it can be seen that the sluice gate cannot be implemented in accordance with the given conditions in the laboratory experi\- ment. Therefore, different simplifications are performed in the model to simulate the develop\- ment of the flushing cone. An additional sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine critical modelling parameters. The simulated shape of the flushing cone, obtained by SSIIM 2, is in good agreement with the laboratory results, even if the modelling results indicate a slight underestimation of the eroded volume. SSIIM 1 predicts the amount of flushed out volume in a better way, but the geometric bed changes are replicated less accurately. Therefore, SSIIM 2 is considered to be more suitable for the modelling of reservoir flushing with partial drawdown, even if some simplifications have to be made in the numerical model.},

  abstract = {Straight rivers are rare in nature and meandering channels are commonplace. It is well known that a channel bed near the outer bank experiences erosion while the inner side is subject to deposition. The ability to predict and estimate the erosion and deposition at meandering bends is important for many water resource projects. Despite that a number of methods have been developed, recent trends are shifting to the process-based multidimensional models. In this study, a two-dimensional depth averaged model is developed to predict the erosion and deposition for meandering channels. The model is first tested and verified using a laboratory channel bend with non-uniform bed sediments. Good agreement is obtained including the prediction of the lateral sediment sorting. The model is then applied to a natural meandering bend on the Sacramento River.},

  abstract = {A polygonal-mesh based numerical method is developed to simulate sediment transport in mobile-bed streams with free surfaces. The flow and sediment transport governing equations are depth-averaged and solved in the two-dimensional (2D) horizontal space. The flow and sediment transport are further coupled to the stream bed changes so that erosion and deposition processes are simulated together with the mobile bed changes. Multiple subsurface bed layers are allowed so that bed stratigraphy may be taken into consideration. The proposed numerical discretization is valid for the most flexible polygonal mesh type which includes all existing meshes in use such as the quadrilateral-triangle hybrid mesh. The finite-volume method is adopted such that the mass conservations of both water and sediment are satisfied locally and globally. The sediment transport and stream bed processes are formulated in a general way so that the proposed numerical method may be applied to a wide range of streams and suitable for practical stream applications. The technical details of the numerical method are presented; model verification and validation studies are reported using selected cases having physical model or field measured data. The developed model is intended for general-purpose use available to the public.},

  abstract = {An analysis of hydrologic and geodetic data from numerous reservoirs lying in different climatic zones, has allowed the two main phases in filling the reservoir during its life to be distinguished,firstly silting of an originally deep reservoir, and secondly silting of a reservoir which has become shallow or initially was not deep. During the first phase, the reservoir plays a role as an accumulatorof sediment, sothat its trap efficiencyfor totalmineral materialis much reduced, and itstrap efficiency for suspended load decreases to zero. This phase ends when the mean depth reaches a critical value which is specificfor each reservoir.Duringthe secondphase, shallowingof thereservoir ismuch slower,and over short time periods it can play a role as a net exporterof sediment. A general model of reservoir sedimentationis proposed and is tested by data on the long-termand seasonal courses of siltationin selected reservoirs in the Vistula drainagebasin, Poland.The rate of sedimentationis analysed for both phases of siltation,and the useful lifetime of a reservoir, which correspondsto the first phase of siltation,has been computed according to a methodology proposed.},

The pedosphere has played a significant role in influencing the gaseous composition of the atmosphere, especially since 1850. Interactive processes that play a major role in the global carbon cycle are those between the pedosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere. There are two types of carbon pools in the pedosphere, e.g., soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC). An increase in SOC, through C sequestration into the pedosphere, has two notable positive effects. First is the enhancement of soil quality, and second is the improvements in the soil's environmental regulatory capacity. Three principal processes of C sequestration in the pedosphere are humification, aggregation, and sedimentation. Each of these processes and their relations to each other need to be clearly understood as do the effects of SOC and SIC leaching and the chemical transformations of dissolved carbon.},

The habitat utilization data were used to develop habitat suitability functions that provide input variables to the instream flow incremental methodology (IFIM) habitat assessment model of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Observations of habitat utilization of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) were obtained during the summer months of 1983 and 1984. The observations were made in small streams with discharges ranging from 0.7 m3 s-1 to 0.03 m3 s-1. The streams are at elevations of 1250 to 2530 m. Equal effort was applied to observing undisturbed trout in all habitat types. Snorkeling proved to be the most effective method of observation. Individual trout of all species and life stages were most often observed in the lower half of the water column, utilizing low-velocity currents of less than 3.0 cm s-1. From the depth and velocity utilization data, several forms of habitat suitability functions were developed and evaluated: 1 Univariate depth and velocity functions derived from frequency histogram analysis. 2 Univariate depth and univariate velocity exponential polynomial models. 3 Bivariate depth and velocity exponential polynomial models. Univariate exponential polynomial models provided the best fit to the data for each species, based on visual comparisons of response surfaces and contour plots, and comparisons of computed sums of squared errors. Bivariate models fitted to the data resulted in greater sums of squared errors than multiplicative aggragation of univariate models, and frequently predicted utilization at zero depth. The habitat suitability functions derived from the univariate exponential polynomial models provided the best input to the IFIM habitat assessment models.},

  abstract = {The hydrological and geomorphic functioning of high-mountain catchments is heavily influenced by snow accumulation and melt processes, which condition the timing and characteristics of discharges, solute outputs, and suspended sediment and bedload transport. We report here the transport of suspended sediment and solutes during the snowmelt period in a small experimental catchment in the subalpine belt of the Central Spanish Pyrenees. The seasonality of hydrological and sediment responses throughout the year was investigated using daily data of discharge, suspended sediment transport and solute outputs of the hydrological years 2003/2004 and 2005/2006. The study demonstrated the importance of the snowmelt period in terms of runoff production, and solute and suspended sediment yield: whereas precipitation during the snowmelt period (2{\textendash}2.5 months) represented 10{\textendash}13\% of annual precipitation, discharge and suspended sediment transport accounted for up to 50\% and 60\%, respectively, and solute output approximately 40{\textendash}50\%. Solute transport dominated throughout the snowmelt period, whereas suspended sediment transport mostly occurred during the second phase of the snowmelt period (June), when an expanding area of the catchment was free from snow. The moderate daily increases in discharge, which were related to day{\textendash}night temperature fluctuations, were insufficient to transport bedload material. Hourly data were used for preliminary assessment of the relationships among discharge, suspended sediment, and solute concentration, which provided insights into sediment sources and delivery mechanisms. Thus, during snowmelt-related events, the sediment mobilized was most probably derived from areas near or within the channel. In contrast, during events involving both snowmelt and rainfall, the gully system near the divide contributed to sediment load. The solute concentration was inversely related to water discharge, with higher concentrations during the first half of the snowmelt period (May) than during the second half (June). The results of this study demonstrate the key role of snow accumulation and melting processes in controlling the hydrological dynamics and patterns of particulate and solute mobilization in high-mountain environments. Future changes in snow volume and duration will affect the timing of snowmelt-related spring high flows, as well as soil erosion and transport.}

  abstract = {This paper addresses the recent trend in fluvial geomorphology towards using computational fluid dynamics to explore the adjustment between flow processes, sediment transport and river channel morphology. It aims to evaluate the extent to which three-dimensional {\v Z}3D. models improve predictive ability and prediction utility compared to two-dimensional {\v Z}2D. applications. This is achieved through comparing the predictions of both 3D and 2D models with high-quality field data. Identical boundary conditions, obtained from a confluence within a gravel-bed river system with high relative roughness, are defined for each model. Evaluation of the 3D model suggests that there is a fundamental limitation upon model predictive ability due to problems of specifying topographic complexity. However, comparison with the 2D model shows that the 3D model has a higher predictive ability, particularly if the 2D model is not corrected for the effects on flow structure of secondary circulation. Further, the 3D model provides more reliable estimates of bed shear stress and other more useful information, such as the three-dimensional flow field important for mixing processes. This suggests that there is significant merit in the move towards 3D models, but that research is required to incorporate methods developed in other fields for dealing with boundary condition uncertainties. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here, we show how stratigraphy is being made in a lake that is heavily impacted upon by climate change and human activities. For one of the largest inner-Alpine catchments in the European Alps, we draw attention to how sedimentation rates are a product of non-stationary, reflexive, human actions. In Lake Geneva, we identify both a human-induced climate change (HCC) signature and the effects of a recent economic shock on sediment extraction upon sediment loading to and sedimentation rates in the lake. The HCC signature thus reflects the nature of climate change impacts in this basin, where sediment accumulation rates evolve with climate, but where economic conditions contribute to shifts in the supply of sediment to the lake. Following social theory, we call this glocalization because of the combined importance and inseparability of human impacts across different spatial scales. The nature of human impacts on sediment delivery to the lake mean that the influence of humans is unlikely to be captured in the long-term depositional record.},

We propose \emph{GRAINet}, a data-driven approach to analyze grain size distributions of entire gravel bars based on georeferenced UAV images. A convolutional neural network is trained to regress grain size distributions as well as the characteristic mean diameter from raw images. \emph{GRAINet} allows the holistic analysis of entire gravel bars, resulting in (i) high-resolution maps of the spatial grain size distribution at large scale, and (ii) robust grading curves for entire gravel bars. To collect a large training dataset of 1,491 samples, we introduce \emph{digital line sampling} as a new annotation strategy, following the widely applied line sampling analysis of Fehr (1987). Our evaluation on 25 gravel bars along 6 different rivers in Switzerland yields high accuracy: The resulting maps of mean diameters have a mean absolute error of 1.1\&thinsp;cm, with no bias. Robust grading curves for entire gravel bars can be extracted if representative training data is available. At the gravel bar level the MAE error of the predicted mean diameter is even reduced to 0.3\&thinsp;cm. Extensive experiments were carried out to study the quality of the digital line samples, the generalization capability of \emph{GRAINet} to new locations, the model performance w.r.t. human labeling noise, the limitations of the current model, and the potential of \emph{GRAINet} to analyze images with low resolutions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The flow and sediment transport processes near steep streambanks, which are commonly found in meandering, braided, and anastomosing stream systems, exhibit complex patterns that produce intricate interactions between bed and bank morphologic adjustment. Increasingly, multi-dimensional computer models of riverine morphodynamics are used to aid in the study of these processes. A number of depthaveraged two-dimensional models are available to simulate morphologic adjustment of both bed and banks. Unfortunately, these models use overly simplified conceptual models of riverbank erosion, are limited by inflexible structured mesh systems, or are unable to accurately account for the flow and sediment transport adjacent to streambanks of arbitrary geometry. A new, nonlinear model is introduced that resolves these limitations. The model combines the river morphodynamics computer models TELEMAC-2D and SISYPHE of the open source TELEMAC-MASCARET suite of solvers with the bank erosion modules of the CONCEPTS channel evolution computer model. The performance of the new model is evaluated for meander-planform initiation and development. The most important findings are: (1) the model is able to simulate a much greater variety and complexity in meander wavelengths; (2) simulated meander development agrees closely with the unified bar-bend theory of Tubino and Seminara (1990); and (3) the rate of meander planform adjustment is greatly reduced if the wavelength of alternate bars is similar to that of meanders.},

Because stranding is dependent on a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors, it is difficult to accurately identify and parameterize fish stranding risks for various river topographies, fish species/lifestages and flow ramping scenarios. This article presents a literature review, new concepts and a novel Python3 algorithm for post-processing two-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model results to identify spatially explicit locations where fish stranding is likely, such as but not limited to downstream of hydropeaking facilities. Compared to previous stranding algorithms, this one is novel in its use of graph theory to find optimal fish escape routes and for its embedding in the free, open-source river analysis software River Architect. Guided by biological parameter selection and supplied with two-dimensional hydrodynamic model rasters, River Architect's Stranding Risk module is suitable for characterization of existing pool stranding risks, alternative flow regime and topographic design evaluation and post-project assessment of rivers during flow recessions.},

This study applies a novel algorithm to predict spatially explicit, meter-resolution fish stranding risk at a river rehabilitation site in California to address three scientific questions. Postproject disconnected wetted area predictions were validated against water surface elevation measurements and time lapse photography of flow reductions and stranding events. A comparison of preproject, final design, and postproject topographies revealed that the occurrence and severity of stranding events is highly sensitive to side-channel topographic structure and postproject morphodynamic change. Even with moderate flows, side-channel exits tend to close off by bars built across them via bedload transport. Implications for river management practices and river rehabilitation project design are discussed.},

This technique used the differential spectral emission signatures of photosynthetic algae and allowed their spatially explicit quantification and community three-dimensional reconstruction. Algal biovolume measurements, carried out with this technique, are superior to existing protocols involving chl and ash-free dry mass assessments because they are nondestructive, localized, and specific at a group level. This technique can be used to generate depth profiles of the periphytic mat with various applications in aquatic ecology and biofilm analysis.}

  abstract = {Several studies in shallow-water sediments have followed the recovery from hypoxia on a macro- or meiobenthic level, but on the microbenthic level such studies are rare. Outdoor flow-through mesocosms were used to monitor the resilience of a microbenthic community and nutrient turnover after hypoxia in natural, previously undisturbed sediment. Variables included oxygen and nutrient fluxes, denitrification and biomass (ch1 a) of microphytobenthos (MPB). Results showed that the community recovered rapidly after hypoxia ({$<$} 15\% of oxygen saturation). In a 7 d experiment preceded by 2 d of hypoxia, the initially changed oxygen and nutrient fluxes remained affected only during the first days after hypoxia. In a 50 d experiment, starting with 17 d of hypoxia, only nitrate under dark conditions remained significantly different at the termination of the experiment after a recovery period of 4.5 wk. The microbenthic community, as well as the basal functions, of shallow-water illuminated sediments possess a high resilience, at least after single events with short periods of hypoxia. This resilience appears to be related to the high resistance of MPB (especially diatoms) to hypoxia, which implies a rapid restoration of the oxygenation of the sediment surface and the base of the food web, securing food supply for new colonising grazers. The recovery was faster for functions under light conditions, indicating that the functions related to microalgal activity are less sensitive to hypoxic events than are heterotrophic processes.}

  abstract = {This paper describes a new method (NSQE) to estimate soil hydraulic properties (sorptivity, S, and hydraulic conductivity, K) from full-time cumulative infiltration curves. The technique relies on an inverse procedure involving the quasi-exact equation of Haverkamp et al. (1994). The numerical resolution is described and the sensitivity of the method is theoretically evaluated, showing that the accuracy of the estimates depends on the measured infiltration time. A new procedure to detect and remove the effect of the contact sand layer on the cumulative infiltration curve is also given. The method was subsequently compared to the differentiated linearization procedure (DL), which calculate K and S from the simplified Haverkamp et al. (1994) equation, valid only for short to medium times. A total of 264 infiltration measurements performed with a 10cm diameter disc under different soil conditions were used. Compared to the DL procedure, field measurements showed that the NSQE method allowed better estimates of soil hydraulic properties, independently on the infiltration noise and the presence of contact sand layer. Overall, although comparable S values were estimated with both methods, the longer infiltration times allowed by the proposed method made this procedure more accurate estimations of K. In conclusion, the NSQE method have shown to be a significant advance to accurate estimate of the soil hydraulic properties form the transient water flow.},

The critical shear stresses required to erode the sediment were measured under different conditions for bed formation. It was discovered that the way in which the bed deposited (i.e. deposited under quiescent conditions or under shear) had a strong influence on the stability of the bed. The critical shear stress for beds deposited under shear was up to eight times larger than that for beds deposited under quiescent conditions. The results suggest that modeling efforts which do not take into account the history of the bed formation may seriously underestimate the bed strength and as such, can result in erroneous predictions of sediment and contaminant source, fate and effect.},

  abstract = {The pattern of fluvial incision across the Himalayas of central Nepal is estimated from the distribution of Holocene and Pleistocene terraces and from the geometry of modern channels along major rivers draining across the range. The terraces provide good constraints on incision rates across the Himalayan frontal folds (Sub-Himalaya or Siwaliks Hills) where rivers are forced to cut down into rising anticlines and have abandoned numerous strath terraces. Farther north and upstream, in the Lesser Himalaya, prominent fill terraces were deposited, probably during the late Pleistocene, and were subsequently incised. The amount of bedrock incision beneath the fill deposits is generally small, suggesting a slow rate of fluvial incision in the Lesser Himalaya. The terrace record is lost in the high range where the rivers are cutting steep gorges. To complement the terrace study, fluvial incision was also estimated from the modern channel geometries using an estimate of the shear stress exerted by the flowing water at the bottom of the channel as a proxy for river incision rate. This approach allows quantification of the effect of variations in channel slope, width, and discharge on the incision rate of a river; the determination of incision rates requires an additional lithological calibration. The two approaches are shown to yield consistent results when applied to the same reach or if incision profiles along nearby parallel reaches are compared. In the Sub-Himalaya, river incision is rapid, with values up to 10{\textendash}15 mm/yr. It does not exceed a few millimeters per year in the Lesser Himalaya, and rises abruptly at the front of the high range to reach values of {$\sim$}4{\textendash}8 mm/yr within a 50-km-wide zone that coincides with the position of the highest Himalayan peaks. Sediment yield derived from the measurement of suspended load in Himalayan rivers suggests that fluvial incision drives hillslope denudation of the landscape at the scale of the whole range. The observed pattern of erosion is found to closely mimic uplift as predicted by a mechanical model taking into account erosion and slip along the flat-ramp-flat geometry of the Main Himalayan Thrust fault. The morphology of the range reflects a dynamic equilibrium between present-day tectonics and surface processes. The sharp relief together with the high uplift rates in the Higher Himalaya reflects thrusting over the midcrustal ramp rather than the isostatic response to reincision of the Tibetan Plateau driven by late Cenozoic climate change, or late Miocene reactivation of the Main Central Thrust.},

  abstract = {The headwaters of the Volga River exhibit large reaches with near-pristine conditions, and therefore long-term biodiversity monitoring of this catchment can provide rare and valuable information on a European lowland river. More specifically, freshwater fish species assemblages are a good indicator of ecosystem status, as they are particularly sensitive to environmental changes and hydromorphological alterations. Historical records show that the fish fauna of the Upper Volga has changed over time, both in species composition and in abundance. The construction of the Volga{\textendash}Kama cascade (a series of large dams) has specifically affected the migration of diadromous species. Environmental DNA metabarcoding offers a non-invasive approach to determine the number of species in an aquatic ecosystem, as well as their identity and distribution. This approach is especially useful for fish fauna surveys along large rivers and long-term biomonitoring, with the advantage of having no impact on the species and their habitats. To infer the current fish species diversity and the spatial distribution of each species in the free-flowing section of the Upper Volga River, as well as in selected tributaries, an environmental DNA metabarcoding approach was applied, using three mitochondrial DNA markers. This method allowed the positive identification of 23 fish species and their respective distributions in the headwaters of the Volga. This assessment provides a valuable example of the application of environmental DNA metabarcoding in a large river system, and constitutes a starting point for future investigations and long-term biomonitoring in the Upper Volga system. In addition, the results can also serve as a reference for fish diversity assessments of other large European lowland rivers, and can guide future conservation and management measures in the headwaters of the Volga.},

Due to the lipophilic characteristics of plastics, oil extraction as a fast and density-independent separation process is beneficial for the crucial extraction step. It was extensively validated (480 experiments) in two test setups by using canola oil and a cost-effective, plastic-free separation unit with spiked microplastics (19 different polymer types) in the density range from               {$\rho$}               = 11{\textendash}1760 kg m               -3               and in the size range from 0.02{\textendash}4.4 mm. Thus, an innovative, new method combination was developed and profoundly validated for water and sediment samples using only a short settling time of 15 minutes. Some experiments were also carried out with zinc chloride to obtain additional reference data (particles {$\leq$} 359 {$\mu$}m). The total mean recovery rate was 89.3\%, 91.7\% within the larger microplastic fraction and 85.7\% for the small fraction. Compared to zinc chloride (87.6\%), recovery rates differed not significantly with oil (87.1\%). Furthermore, size limits were set, since the method works best with particles 0.02 mm {$\geq$}               d               {$\leq$} 3 mm. The proposed method exhibits higher efficiency (84.8\% for 20{\textendash}63 {$\mu$}m) for the potentially most harmful microplastic size fraction than the classic setup using brine solution. As a result, oil is a comparably effective separation medium and offers further advantages for separating water and sediment samples due to its density independence, simple and fast application and environmental friendliness. Based on this, a new extraction protocol is presented here that confirms oil separation as a sound and effective separation process in microplastic analysis and identifies previously missing information.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, copula functions have been applied in bivariate drought duration and severity frequency analysis. Among several potential copulas, Clayton has been mostly used in drought analysis. In this research, we studied the influence of the tail shape of various copula functions (i.e. Gumbel, Frank, Clayton and Gaussian) on drought bivariate frequency analysis. The appropriateness of Clayton copula for the characterization of drought characteristics is also investigated. Drought data are extracted from standardized precipitation index time series for four stations in Canada (La Tuque and Grande Prairie) and Iran (Anzali and Zahedan). Both duration and severity data sets are positively skewed. Different marginal distributions were first fitted to drought duration and severity data. The gamma and exponential distributions were selected for drought duration and severity, respectively, according to the positive skewness and Kolmogorov{\textendash}Smirnov test. The results of copula modelling show that the Clayton copula function is not an appropriate choice for the used data sets in the current study and does not give more drought risk information than an independent model for which the duration and severity dependence is not significant. The reason is that the dependence of two variables in the upper tail of Clayton copula is very weak and similar to the independent case, whereas the observed data in the transformed domain of cumulative density function show high association in the upper tail. Instead, the Frank and Gumbel copula functions show better performance than Clayton function for drought bivariate frequency analysis. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The field of citizen science is a rapidly evolving type of scientific research focussing on the collaboration of motivated volunteers (citizen scientists) with professional scientists to generate new knowledge and information. In recent years, there has been a steady growth of Earth Science related citizen science projects that aim to build knowledge, awareness and ultimately resilience to key local- to global-scale environmental issues (e.g., geohazards, environmental monitoring). In addition, there has also been progression from small pilot studies to large data collection Earth Science citizen science initiatives that are used to underpin modelling. However, despite this, numerous operational and strategic challenges exist and whilst the awareness of citizen science has improved markedly, it is clear that the direct impact of citizen science on policy and decision making is still limited. Within this paper, we review these challenges alongside defining citizen science itself, and its benefits. The range of methods and applications of citizen science are explored through a series of case studies centred on geohazards, observations \& classification, multi-topic, and education/outreach. The paper also explores future citizen science opportunities within Earth Science.},

  abstract = {Successful monitoring of ecologically significant, vulnerable fluvial systems will require improved quantitative techniques for mapping channel morphology and in-stream habitat. In this study, we assess the ability of remote sensing to contribute to these objectives by (1) describing the underlying radiative transfer processes, drawing upon research conducted in shallow marine environments; (2) modeling the effects of water depth, substrate type, suspended sediment concentration, and surface turbulence; (3) quantifying the limitations imposed by finite detector sensitivity and linear quantization; and (4) evaluating two depth retrieval algorithms using simulated and field-measured spectra and archival imagery. The degree to which variations in depth and substrate can be resolved depends on bottom albedo and water column optical properties, and scattering by suspended sediment obscures substrate spectral features and reduces the resolution of depth estimates. Converting continuous radiance signals to discrete digital numbers implies that depth estimates take the form of contour intervals that become wider as depth increases and as bottom albedo and detector sensitivity decrease. Our results indicate that a simple band ratio can provide an image-derived variable that is strongly linearly related to water depth across a broad range of stream conditions. This technique outperformed the linear transform method used in previous stream studies, most notably for upwelling radiance spectra [R2=0.79 for the ln(560 nm/690 nm) ratio]. Applied to uncalibrated multispectral and hyperspectral images of a fourth-order stream in Yellowstone National Park, this flexible technique produced hydraulically reasonable maps of relative depth. Although radiometric precision and spatial resolution will impose fundamental limitations in practice, remote mapping of channel morphology and in-stream habitat is feasible and can become a powerful tool for scientists and managers.},

By comparing current conditions of climate and water use with future scenarios, an overview is provided of today's potential for hydroelectricity generation and its mid- and long-term prospects. The application of the global water model WaterGAP for discharge calculations allows for an integrated assessment, taking both climate and socioeconomic changes into account. This study comprises two key parts: First, the `gross' hydropower potential is analyzed, in order to outline the general distribution and trends in hydropower capabilities across Europe. Then, the assessment focuses on the `developed' hydropower potential of existing hydropower plants, in order to allow for a more realistic picture of present and future electricity production. For the second part, a new data set has been developed which geo-references 5991 European hydropower stations and distinguishes them into run-of-river and reservoir stations. The results of this study present strong indications that, following moderate climate and global change scenario assumptions, severe future alterations in discharge regimes have to be expected, leading to unstable regional trends in hydropower potentials with reductions of 25\% and more for southern and southeastern European countries.},

Design and optimization of trawl-doors using computational models are a key factor in minimizing the fuel consumption. This paper presents an optimization algorithm for the shape design of trawl-door shapes using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models. Accurate CFD models are computationally expensive. Therefore, the direct use of traditional optimization algorithms, which often require a large number of evaluations, may be prohibitive. The proposed approach is iterative and uses low-order local response surface approximation models of the expensive CFD model, constructed in each iteration, to reduce the number of evaluations. The algorithm is applied to the design of a multi-element trawl-doors, involving up to four design variables controlling the angle of attack and the slat and flap position and orientation. The results show that a satisfactory design can be obtained at the cost of a few iterations of the algorithm.},

The model was calibrated using observed data from 2005 and then applied to simulate 2 scenarios: high-stage with an initial water level of 370.0 m and low-stage with a projected initial water level of 320.0 m. The high-stage simulation described predrought lake hydrodynamics, while the low-stage simulation projected how lake circulation could respond under significant lake drawdown, should drought conditions persist. The results indicate that water level drawdown plays an important role in thermal stratification and water movement of Lake Mead during receding water levels. The impact of the dropping water level on lake thermal stratification is more significant in shallow regions such as Las Vegas Bay. Depth-averaged (the mean value of 30 vertical layers) water temperature in the low-stage was estimated to increase by 4{\textendash}7 C and 2{\textendash}4 C for shallow ({$<$}20 m) and deep ({$>$}70 m) regions, respectively. Further, depth-averaged water age decreased about 70{\textendash}90 d for shallow regions and 90{\textendash}120 d for deep regions under the simulated drought scenario. Such changes in temperature and water age due to continuous drought will have a strong influence on the hydrodynamic processes of Lake Mead.

PEST is designed for easy linkage with other models and has been applied to many distributed hydrological model. Therefore, the PEST model is selected in this paper to link with the WATLAC model and calibrate the parameters, and compare the calibration results with manual results. The results show that the difference of two group parameter values is obvious. The PEST model can easily drive the WATLAC model and gain the optimal parameter values efficiently. The WATLAC model produces an overall good fit, the Ens values, except in 2001, are more than 0.83 and with an average of 0.93. But the relative runoff depth errors are larger slightly than manual results. The simulated stream flow hydrographs with PEST demonstrated a closer agreement with the observed hydrographs, while, the model simulation using manual calibration method behaved not very well and there was a tendency for the model to enlarge the peak flows.},

  abstract = {Spatially continuous data of environmental variables are often required for environmental sciences and management. However, information for environmental variables is usually collected by point sampling, particularly for the mountainous region and deep ocean area. Thus, methods generating such spatially continuous data by using point samples become essential tools. Spatial interpolation methods (SIMs) are, however, often data-specific or even variable-specific. Many factors affect the predictive performance of the methods and previous studies have shown that their effects are not consistent. Hence it is difficult to select an appropriate method for a given dataset. This review aims to provide guidelines and suggestions regarding application of SIMs to environmental data by comparing the features of the commonly applied methods which fall into three categories, namely: non-geostatistical interpolation methods, geostatistical interpolation methods and combined methods. Factors affecting the performance, including sampling design, sample spatial distribution, data quality, correlation between primary and secondary variables, and interaction among factors, are discussed. A total of 25 commonly applied methods are then classified based on their features to provide an overview of the relationships among them. These features are quantified and then clustered to show similarities among these 25 methods. An easy to use decision tree for selecting an appropriate method from these 25 methods is developed based on data availability, data nature, expected estimation, and features of the method. Finally, a list of software packages for spatial interpolation is provided.},

It is shown that the velocities in the vegetation area are much smaller than those in the non-vegetation area and a large velocity gradient is generated between the vegetation area and the non-vegetation area. The transverse and longitudinal dispersion coefficients are analyzed based on the experimental data by using the modified N - zone models. It is shown that the effect of the vegetation on the transverse dispersion coefficient is small, involving only changes of a small magnitude, however, since the primary velocities become much more inhomogeneous with the presence of the vegetation, the longitudinal dispersion coefficients are much larger than those in the non-vegetation case.},

In such a situation, system model parameters are estimated using tests at lower levels of complexity which share the same model parameters with the system. For such a multi-level problem, this paper proposes a methodology to quantify the uncertainty in the system level prediction by integrating calibration, validation and sensitivity analysis at different levels. The proposed approach considers the validity of the models used for parameter estimation at lower levels, as well as the relevance at the lower level to the prediction at the system level. The model validity is evaluated using a model reliability metric, and models with multivariate output are considered. The relevance is quantified by comparing Sobol indices at the lower level and system level, thus measuring the extent to which a lower level test represents the characteristics of the system so that the calibration results can be reliably used in the system level. Finally the results of calibration, validation and relevance analysis are integrated in a roll-up method to predict the system output.},

  abstract = {Investigations of coupled multiphysics processes in rivers and hyporheic zones have extensively used numerical models. Most existing models use a sequential, one-way coupling between the surface and subsurface domains. Such one-way coupling potentially introduces error. To overcome this, a fully coupled model, hyporheicFoam, was developed using the open-source computational platform OpenFOAM. It captures the coupled flow and multicomponent reactive transport processes within both surface and subsurface domains and across their interface. The coupling between two domains is implemented by mapping conservative flux boundary conditions at the interface through an iterative algorithm. Reactive transport is enabled by specifying a reaction network. To start, we have implemented reaction kinetics following the double Monod-type model with inhibition. The model capability is illustrated through modeling of both conservative and reactive hyporheic flow and transport through dune bedforms. With the novel coupled model, it is now possible to quantify reactions wherein the reactants and products are constantly exchanging between domains and have feedbacks. hyporheicFoam can simulate large, three-dimensional cases owing to the computational flexibility and power offered by the code structure and parallel design of OpenFOAM.},

  abstract = {Meandering is one of the unique processes in Earth surface dynamics. Since the 1960s, fluvial geomorphologists have generalized numerous widely-acknowledged empirical or semi-empirical formulae to describe meandering rivers' characteristics. The most frequently applied one is the Kinoshita high-sinuosity curve to describe meander channel planform geometry. Combining the Kinoshita curve with the Beck equations to describe the riverbed topography at equilibrium state, a prototype of a synthetic riverbed topography generating model is made for idealized meandering rivers. Such a method can be readily extended and applied to arbitrary meandering rivers in the real world, resulting in the synthetic riverbed topography model, pyRiverBed, presented herein. A meander migration and neck cutoff submodel is also embedded in pyRiverBed. Unlike existing linear and non-linear bend theory-based models, pyRiverbed aims towards generating the riverbed topography for each snapshot during the migration process. The present model can facilitate meandering river researchers to interpolate their field-measured bathymetric data using the synthetic bed, design their non-flat bed laboratory flumes for experiments, and initialize their hydrodynamic and morphodynamic numerical models. It can also provide guidance in stream restoration projects on designing a channel with a morphodynamic equilibrium bed. The quality of generated synthetic bed topography is evaluated through the comparison against both laboratory experiment data and field-measured data. The meander migration submodel is validated using a real-world channel migration and neck cutoff event. The validation results prove that the synthetic riverbed's accuracy is reasonably good, and the meander migration submodel can successfully predict meander migration and neck cutoff.},

Less attention has been paid to small dams (hydraulic size\,{$<$}\,0.01) in remote mountains with urgent sedimentation problems. In drier climates, such reservoirs may be frequently drained and trans-catchment flows routed over their sediment deposits heading from one mountain tunnel to another. This study asked an unexplored scientific question focusing on this special setting: how do different amounts of water transfers interact with different reservoir stages to affect sediment erosion and its redistribution in the backwater zone? Mindful timing and magnitude adjustment of water transfer, involving water diverted across watersheds by tunnels, through a reservoir were hypothesized to strategically redistribute sediment erosion for sites with water transfer/diversion facilities in the main channel. For a study site in the north-central Sierra Mountains of California, 2D hydrodynamic modeling revealed that sediment erosion within the backwater zone increased by\,{$>$}\,100\% when water transfer was maximized, involving a flow 12 times higher than mean annual discharge. With reservoir stage drawdown, the increment of sediment erosion was further increased by\,{$>$}\,50\% compared with water-transfer-only scenarios. The natural upstream inflow with daily flow occurrence of 5{\textendash}25\% was the optimal water transfer to avoid disturbing sediment. These results indicated that water transfer and stage drawdown optimization is a promising strategy to promote or abate redistribution of deposited sediment through a smaller reservoir.},

One major disadvantage is the lack of adaptiveness, which may compromise accuracy in fluid regions such as splashes and surfaces. Attempts to address this problem used variable smoothing lengths. Yet the existing methods are computationally complex and non-efficient, because the smoothing length is typically calculated using iterative optimization. Here, we propose an efficient non-iterative SPH fluid simulation method with variable smoothing length (VSLSPH). VSLSPH correlates the smoothing length to the density change, and adaptively adjusts the smoothing length of particles with high accuracy and low computational cost, enabling large time steps. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the VSLSPH approach in terms of its simulation accuracy and efficiency.},

It is a rule-based cellular morphodynamic model, in contrast to reductionist models based on detailed computational fluid dynamics. The basic framework of this model (DeltaRCM) consists of stochastic parcel-based cellular routing schemes for water and sediment and a set of phenomenological rules for sediment deposition and erosion. The outputs of the model include a depth-averaged flow field, water surface elevation and bed topography that evolve in time. Results show that DeltaRCM is able (1) to resolve a wide range of channel dynamics {\textendash} including elongation, bifurcation, avulsion and migration {\textendash} and (2) to produce a variety of deltas such as alluvial fan deltas and deltas with multiple orders of bifurcations. We also demonstrate a simple stratigraphy recording component which tracks the distribution of coarse and fine materials and the age of the deposits. Essential processes that must be included in reduced-complexity delta models include a depth-averaged flow field that guides sediment transport a nontrivial water surface profile that accounts for backwater effects at least in the main channels, both bedload and suspended sediment transport, and topographic steering of sediment transport.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The recent example of the October 2020 Storm Alex in SE France ({$\sim$}500~mm of rain in 24~h) provides a unique opportunity to investigate major geomorphic responses along 70~km of two confined alpine valleys (V{\'e}subie and Roya) and to link them to sediment wave initiation and propagation. GIS-based analysis of remote sensing data (high-resolution ortho-imagery and airborne LiDAR data) acquired before and after the flood allowed combining channel changes with sediment erosion and deposition along a 35-km reach of the V{\'e}subie, including the most impacted portions of the valley. In the Roya, the analysis was restricted to 2D morphological changes reconstructed with the sequence of ortho-imagery. Archives of aerial imagery were also used to integrate the storm impact in the historical trajectory of the rivers. The reconstruction of geomorphic responses shows a quasi-continuous fluvial metamorphosis along the investigated stream networks, with dramatic active channel widening and aggradation, having no antecedent analogs during the last 70~years in both valleys. The different glacial imprints between the two valleys are considered a key factor explaining the exacerbated channel response in the V{\'e}subie, where a braided channel emerged along a 35-km river length. Many evidences strongly support that the fuelling effect of alluvial storage is a key element of the sediment cascade at the origin of the braided channel formation. This regional case study allows us to discuss the critical role of floodplain and terrace erosion in the formation of the post-flood braided channel, and to compare the geomorphic impact of the storm with similar reported cases in the literature.},

We present a twostage routine for automatic calibration of the semidistributed watershed model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) that finds the best values for the model parameters, preserves spatial variability in essential parameters, and leads to a measure of the model prediction uncertainty. In the first stage, a modified global Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA) method was employed to find the ``best'' values for the lumped model parameters. In the second stage, the spatial variability of the original model parameters was restored and a local search method (a variant of Levenberg{\textendash}Marquart method) was used to find a more distributed set of parameters using the results of the previous stage as starting values. A method called ``regularization'' was adopted to prevent the parameters from taking extreme values. In addition, we applied a nonlinear calibration-constrained method to develop confidence intervals for annual and 7-d average flow predictions. We calibrated stream flow in the Etowah River measured at Canton, GA (a watershed area of 1580 km2) for the years 1983 to 1992 and used the years 1993 to 2001 for validation. The Parameter Estimator (PEST) software was used to conduct the two-stage automatic calibration and prediction uncertainty analysis. Calibration for daily and monthly flow produced a very good fit to the measured data. NashSutcliffe coefficients for daily and monthly flow over the calibration period were 0.60 and 0.86, respectively. They were 0.61 and 0.87, respectively, for the validation period. The nonlinear prediction uncertainty analysis worked well for long-term (annual) flow in that our prediction confidence intervals included or were very near to the observed flow for most years. It did not work well for short-term (7-d average) flows in that the prediction confidence intervals did not include the observed flow, especially for low and high flow conditions.},

We estimate floodplain soil OC stocks within the active layer (seasonally thawed layer) and to a maximum depth of 1 m from a large field data set in the Yukon Flats region of interior Alaska. We compare our estimated stocks to a previously published data set and find that the OC stock estimate using our field data could be as much as 68\% higher than the published data set. Radiocarbon measurements indicate that sediment and associated OC can be stored for thousands of years before erosion and transport. Our results indicate the importance of floodplains as areas of underestimated carbon storage, particularly because climate change may modify geomorphic processes in permafrost regions.},

  abstract = {Incubating salmonid eggs in streambeds are often threatened by deposition of fine sediment within the gravel. To relate sedimentation of spawning gravel beds to sediment transport, infiltration of fine sediment ({$<$}2 mm in diameter) into clean gravel beds, bed material size distributions, scour-fill depths, and sediment transport during 10 storm flow events were measured in three streams of north coastal California. Although suspended sediment comprised most (75{\textendash}94\%) of the clastic load during storm flows, bed load material (0.25{\textendash}2 mm) accounted for most (70{\textendash}78\%) of the fine sediment accumulated in experimental gravel implanted in the streambeds. Sand trapped in the interstices of the top several centimeters formed a seal that impeded deeper deposition of very fine sand and finer material. The seal was responsible at least in part for a decrease in the rate of fine-sediment accumulation with increasing cumulative bed load transport. Areas of the streambeds commonly scoured or filled 0.1 m or more during storm flows, and thus scour and fill commonly created a sandy layer at least as thick as the seal formed by sediment infiltration. Scour could erode eggs laid in the bed and expose deeper levels of the bed to infiltration by fine sediment, but at the same time could allow fine sediment to be winnowed away. Great temporal and spatial variation in sedimentation in these streams suggests that individual storms of moderate size pose a threat to eggs in many but not all areas selected by fish for spawning.},

  abstract = {Ground-water and surface flow depletions are altering riparian ecosystems throughout the southwestern United States, and have contributed to the decline of forests of the pioneer trees Populus fremontii (Fremont cottonwood) and Salix gooddingii (Goodding willow). On some rivers, these forests have been replaced by shrublands of Tamarix ramosissima (tamarisk), a drought-tolerant species from Eurasia. The physiological response of these three riparian plant species to decreases in water availability is well studied, but little attention has been given to shifts in community and population structure in response to declines in surface flow and ground-water levels. Based on study of 17 sites spanning a hydrologic gradient, this research identified hydrologic thresholds above which P. fremontii{\dbend}S. gooddingii maintain tall dense stands with diverse age classes, and above which they are more abundant than T. ramosissima stands along the San Pedro River in Arizona. Surface flow permanence was the hydrologic variable that explained most of the variance in species abundance and relative importance, with inter-annual ground-water fluctuation and depth to ground water also contributing. P. fremontii and S. gooddingii were dominant over T. ramosissima at sites where surface flow was present more than 76\% of the time, inter-annual ground-water fluctuation was less than 0.5 m, and average maximum depth to ground water was less than 2.6 m, during a two-year period of data collection. Because T. ramosissima is a shrub species with smaller leaves and lower canopy heights than P. fremontii and S. gooddingii, these shifts in species composition corresponded to decreases in maximum canopy height and upper stratum (above 8 m) vegetation volume as site water availability declined. As well, sites with deeper water tables and more intermittent flows had greater areal coverage of shrublands and less of woodlands. The altered vegetation structure along dewatered rivers may lower wildlife habitat quality. This study provides river managers with quantitative hydrologic guidelines for conserving tall dense P. fremontii{\dbend}S. gooddingii stands and emphasizes the importance of maintaining long-term hydrologic conditions that are favorable to these species. The study also has implications for riparian restoration and invasive species management by suggesting that desired outcomes may be achieved through restoration of physical processes.},

  abstract = {Genetic algorithms (GAs) and Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGAs) have proven to be successful in calibrating numerical models. The limitation of using GAs and MOGAs is their expensive computational requirement. The calibration process usually needs to run the numerical model and evaluate the objective function thousands of times before converging to an acceptable solution and generating a sufficiently accurate Pareto set. However, in real world applications, there is simply not enough time and resources to perform such a huge number of model runs. In this study, a computational framework, known as GA-kNN, is presented for solving computationally expensive calibration problems. The concept of GA-kNN will be demonstrated via one novel approximate model using k-Nearest Neighbour classifier. This study also investigates Pareto ranks estimation using kNN classifier as a way to speed up multi-objective genetic algorithm search, namely NSGA-II-kNN. The approximation model is performed in predicting the form of Pareto ranks instead of running the simulation models and ranking current population. This approach can substantially reduce the number of model evaluations on computational expensive problems without compromising the good search capabilities of NSGA-II. The simulation results suggest that the proposed optimisation frameworks are able to achieve good solutions as well as provide considerable savings of the numerical model calls compared to traditional GA and NSGA-II optimisation frameworks.},

Analysis of the dataset leads to question the usual section averaged sampling procedure of bedload using Helley-Smith type bedload sampler. It is shown that this procedure is inadequate to catch the full range of flow conditions. Comparison between moving averages on individual datasets and section averages furthermore show that this technique can lead to significantly different rating curves with predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. Single point sampling is shown to be much more adequate than multiple point sampling and section averaging provided the dataset is sufficiently large.},

  abstract = {Metamodeling is becoming a rather popular means to approximate the expensive simulations in today's complex engineering design problems since accurate metamodels can bring in a lot of benefits. The metamodel accuracy, however, heavily depends on the locations of the observed points. Adaptive sampling, as its name suggests, places more points in regions of interest by learning the information from previous data and metamodels. Consequently, compared to traditional space-filling sampling approaches, adaptive sampling has great potential to build more accurate metamodels with fewer points (simulations), thereby gaining increasing attention and interest by both practitioners and academicians in various fields. Noticing that there is a lack of reviews on adaptive sampling for global metamodeling in the literature, which is needed, this article categorizes, reviews, and analyzes the state-of-the-art single-/multi-response adaptive sampling approaches for global metamodeling in support of simulation-based engineering design. In addition, we also review and discuss some important issues that affect the success of an adaptive sampling approach as well as providing brief remarks on adaptive sampling for other purposes.

Determining optimal values of the model parameters is formulated as training hidden neurons within a machine learning framework, based on available financial option prices. The framework consists of two parts: a forward pass in which we train the weights of the ANN off-line, valuing options under many different asset model parameter settings; and a backward pass, in which we evaluate the trained ANN-solver on-line, aiming to find the weights of the neurons in the input layer. The rapid on-line learning of implied volatility by ANNs, in combination with the use of an adapted parallel global optimization method, tackles the computation bottleneck and provides a fast and reliable technique for calibrating model parameters while avoiding, as much as possible, getting stuck in local minima. Numerical experiments confirm that this machine-learning framework can be employed to calibrate parameters of high-dimensional stochastic volatility models efficiently and accurately.},

Both the critical turbulence and critical velocity for resuspension had no dependence on stem diameter. However, for denser canopies and/or a canopy of smaller stem size, a greater energy slope is required to initiate resuspension.

We test this hypothesis by systematically comparing characteristics of 183 logjams from 17 stream reaches in the Southern Rocky Mountains. Our data set is novel in that it evaluates naturally occurring logjams in unaltered streams in a single study area specifically based on whether they span the stream channel. We find that channel-spanning logjams have a significantly larger number of wood pieces, longer \& wider pieces, more ramp and bridge pieces, and greater logjam height and volume, both as raw data and when standardized by average channel width. Channel-spanning logjams also have significantly greater backwater pool volume and volume of particulate organic matter stored in backwater pools and in logjams. Restoration employing engineered logjams in relatively small channels currently focuses on non-spanning logjams, but could be expanded to include spanning logjams.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate related processes of sediment consolidation and resuspension in a coastal basin and how these processes influence retention of fine sediment delivered by a river diversion. Sediment samples were collected from Lake Lery, a coastal receiving basin of the Caernarvon Diversion from the Mississippi River, Louisiana. Consolidation was tested for six initial sediment concentrations (14.0{\textendash}105 kg m{\textendash}3) in a settling column over 15-day periods. Mud erodibility was tested at seven shear stress regimes (0.01{\textendash}0.60 Pa) using a dual-core Gust erosion microcosm system, on cores containing suspensions that consolidated for 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Consolidation rates were found to be inversely and exponentially related to initial suspension concentration, over concentrations ranging from fluid mud (10{\textendash}200 kg m{\textendash}3) to hydraulic dredge effluent. Consolidation is best predicted by a function consisting of two exponential terms and one asymptotic constant, describing rates of rapid initial and slower subsequent settling. Coupled resuspension and consolidation tests (concentrations of 20{\textendash}21 kg m{\textendash}3) show that shear stresses generating the highest turbidity peaks increase from {$\leq$}0.30 Pa after 2 weeks of consolidation to {$\geq$}0.45 Pa after 4 weeks, and this strengthening cannot be attributed solely to increasing sediment concentration over time. Comparison of measured erosion shear stresses with bed shear stresses typical of coastal lakes and bays suggests that this degree of strengthening, if given time to occur, could increase the overall retention of fine sediments deposited on lake and bay floors.},

This complicates the diagnosis of hydromorphological alterations and hampers the design of effective restoration measures. Here, we present a conceptual meta-analysis that aims at identifying the most relevant hydromorphological processes and variables controlling ecological degradation and restoration. For that purpose, we used fuzzy cognitive mapping based on conceptual schemes that were created according to 675 scientific peer-reviewed river hydromorphology studies. A model generated from this approach predicts responses that are consistent with common understanding of the direct interactions between hydromorphological pressures, processes and variables. However, it also leads to new knowledge beyond traditional hydromorphological models by dealing with the complex interactions of hydromorphology, vegetation, water chemistry and thermal regime. Water flow dynamics appeared as the most important of all hydromorphological processes affected by simultaneously interacting pressures. Relevant processes such as vegetation encroachment and sediment entrainment are closely linked to water flow. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate the relevance of natural flow regime rehabilitation for river management. Hence, we suggest focusing primarily on rehabilitating the natural flow regime before carrying out extensive habitat restoration works. This challenging target in river rehabilitation could strongly increase the success of additional habitat restoration.},

  abstract = {Increasing natural and anthropogenic deposition of nitrate (NO3-) and sulfate (SO42-) to peatlands may modify CH4 oxidation, CO2 and N2O production, thereby affecting the balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) globally. Among environmental factors controlling these biogeochemical processes, effects of peatland microrelief are poorly understood. Fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were measured before and after incubation with NO3- and SO42- for peat samples collected from various microrelief positions of a boreal oligotrophic mire in Eastern Finland. Soil was spiked with 13CH4 to understand the processes of CH4 oxidation, its microbial utilization and incorporation into soil organic matter (SOM). We hypothesized that the addition of NO3- and SO42- would 1) stimulate CO2 and N2O production (nutritional effect), but 2) decrease CH4 oxidation due to acceleration of other more energetically favorable processes (e.g. denitrification), and 3) these patterns should follow the naturally established aerobic zone of a microform type and decrease with depth. Microbial biomass (MB) at 50~cm below all microforms was 9{\textendash}15 folds higher than in the topsoil. MB controlled the GHG dynamics and was related to specific depth-dependent environmental conditions, rather than oxygen availability. Indeed, production of CO2 and N2O, and oxidation potentials of CH4 revealed no clear linkage with the naturally established aeration zone of the peatland's microforms. Following NO3- and SO42- addition, production of CO2 decreased by 20{\textendash}65\% compared to the control, with the greatest reduction in CO2 emission occurring in the topsoil of hollows. In turn, CH4 oxidation was suppressed by 20{\textendash}94\% with NO3- addition at 50~cm in lawns and with both NO3- and SO42- at 50~cm in hollows. The N2O production was increased up to 180{\textendash}240 times under NO3- treatment at 50~cm in hollows and lawns. In conclusion, human-induced deposition of NO3- and SO42- may suppress CO2 emissions from and CH4 oxidation by boreal oligotrophic mires especially under the conditions of deposition increase. Finally, the deposition of inorganic compounds is strongly important to be considered in the estimation of ecosystem C and N balances.},

  abstract = {Climate change characterized by increasing temperature is able to affect precipitation regime and thus surface hydrology. However, the manner in which river sediment loads respond to climate change is not well understood, and related assessment regarding the effect of climate change on sediment loads is lacking. We present a quantitative estimate of changes in sediment loads (from 1.5 Gt yr-1 pre-1990 to 0.6 Gt yr-1 from 1991{\textendash}2007) in response to climate change in eight large Chinese rivers. Over the past decades, precipitation change coupled with rising temperatures has played a significant role in influencing the sediment delivery dynamics, although human activities, such as reservoir construction, water diversion, sand mining and land cover change, are still the predominant forces. Lower precipitation coupled with rising temperatures has significantly reduced sediment loads delivered into the sea in semi-arid climates (4{\textendash}61\%). In contrast, increasingly warmer and wetter climates in subtropical zones has yielded more sediment (0.4{\textendash}11\%), although the increase was offset by human impact. Our results indicate that, compared with mechanical retention by reservoirs, water reduction caused by climate change or human withdrawals has contributed more sediment reduction for the rivers with abundant sediment supply but limited transport capacity (e.g., the Huanghe). Furthermore, our results indicate that every 1\% change in precipitation has resulted in a 1.3\% change in water discharge and a 2\% change in sediment loads. In addition, every 1\% change in water discharge caused by precipitation has led to a 1.6\% change in sediment loads, but the same percentage of water discharge change caused largely by humans would only result in a 0.9\% change in sediment loads. These figures can be used as a guideline for evaluating the responses of sediment loads to climate change in similar climate zones because future global warming will cause dramatic changes in water and sediment in river basins worldwide at rates previously unseen.},

  abstract = {The present work revisits the classical, uniform-width bend theory with the aim to understand whether and how spatial width oscillations can affect the process of linear bend stability that initiates meander planform evolution. Although longitudinal oscillations of channel width are common along many meandering streams, little investigation of their properties and dynamic effects has been pursued so far. The theory therefore accounts for width variations as a geometrical forcing in a depthaveraged model of meander morphodynamics by assuming the potential interaction with the classical curvature forcing effect. A first quantification of width variations is made by referring to a freely evolving meandering river, which shows that the dimensionless amplitude of width variations is a `small' parameter with comparable magnitude to that of curvature variations, thus suggesting the use of a two-parameter perturbation expansion. Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that channel width oscillates in space with a double frequency relative to curvature, which implies that one nonlinear interaction between the two forcing effects is enough to reproduce the effect of spatial width variations on the process of bend stability. Overall, width variations consistently promote the instability of shorter bends with respect to meanders with uniform width: on average, this predicted tendency is supported by analysis of field data referring to hundreds of natural meander bends. The effect on meander wavelength selection depends on the location of the widest section relative to the bend apex. Under typical formative conditions of gravel-bed rivers, with largeenough channel aspect ratios, two distinct most unstable longitudinal modes develop. Such behaviour is absent when the width is uniform, and suggests a mechanistic interpretation for the reach-scale occurrence of chute cutoffs that can be observed more frequently in wider-at-bends than in equiwidth meandering channels.},

  abstract = {{\O}resund is a narrow sound between Denmark and Sweden in Northern Europe. The sound has a complex hydrography with two- or three-layer stratifications, sometimes with opposite directed currents in the different layers. The complicated hydrography makes it difficult to investigate sediment dynamics by use of traditional field-work based methods. In this study the three-dimensional modelling system MIKE 3 was applied in order to quantify the dynamics of the fine-grained sediment in {\O}resund over a year. The model simulated the complex hydrodynamics including stratification satisfactorily. The simulated suspended sediment concentrations were low, generally not exceeding 20 mg l-1. Over the year 2000 the model computed an annual accumulation of 136,000 tons of sediment. Both the sediment concentrations and the overall accumulation of fine-grained sediment are in accordance with previously published results. This study presents some general hydrodynamic and sedimentological characteristics from the sound. The hydrodynamic characteristics were well reproduced, making the hydrodynamic model ideal for the sediment transport study. The description of the sedimentology of the sound is in some aspects new and is therefore not directly verified by data. The overall result is believed to be representative for the area and the model has given information on sedimentological transport patterns. This study demonstrated that generic numerical cohesive sediment transport models are capable of simulating hydrodynamics and cohesive sediment dynamics in complicated estuarine environments and of establishing reliable sediment budgets.},

Their production of new extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) increases the erosion threshold and decreases the erosion rate. To predict this build up of biostability in cohesive sediments, it is therefore vital to understand the EPS production rates for both diatoms and bacteria under different ecological conditions. The present study examined the production of EPS as function of light intensity and linked this to biostabilisation. Microbenthos was sampled from a Danish marine embayment at 5-m depth. A 10-day comparison of EPS production under light and under dark conditions showed that the bacterial EPS production hardly changed during the experiment, while the algal EPS production was significantly high already from day I and reached a maximum production on day 10. Erosion threshold of natural cohesive sediments was determined in annular flumes after variable consolidation periods under similar light/dark conditions. The evolutions of erosion threshold and EPS concentration correlated well under light conditions, while the development in dark conditions showed no significant correlation, indicating that diatoms are more efficient in sediment stabilisation than bacteria. Further it seems, that the studied biological-sedimentary system needs 2-3 days of acclimatisation before the production of EPS can be well correlated with the increase of sediment stability.

The flumes were aerated and subjected to different light/dark conditions; antibiotics were used to isolate diatom from bacteria effects. During consolidation. a constant current velocity was maintained, at a speed well below erosion threshold. 'Natural' sediment regained 27\% of its original stability after I day, and 85\% after 5 days. Complete 'natural' sediment stability was regained within 10 days. Benthic diatoms (mainly Nitzchia sp., Gyrosigma sp. and Pennales sp.) were responsible for about 80\% of the biostabilisation, whilst bacteria contributed similar to 12\%, indicating the importance of light as a controlling factor for surface sediment stability. Relative to physico-chemical binding, the increase in erosion threshold induced by benthic diatoms was 120\%, and by bacteria 20\%. Where the assemblage consisted of both diatoms and bacteria, the increase was 150\%, indicating that natural bed values are not a simple summation of the two effects, i.e. diatoms Plus bacteria. Using the results, a first generation empirical relationship describing the relative contributions of microbenthic and physico-chemical factors in the development of erosion threshold is presented. Empirical relationships containing biostabilisation coefficients are important for better computer model predictions of sediment transport. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Riverbank retreat along a bend of the Cecina River, Tuscany (central Italy) was monitored across a near annual cycle (autumn 2003 to summer 2004) with the aim of better understanding the factors influencing bank changes and processes at a seasonal scale. Seven flow events occurred during the period of investigation, with the largest having an estimated return period of about 1{$\cdot$}5 years. Bank simulations were performed by linking hydrodynamic, fluvial erosion, groundwater flow and bank stability models, for the seven flow events, which are representative of the typical range of hydrographs that normally occur during an annual cycle. The simulations allowed identification of (i) the time of onset and cessation of mass failure and fluvial erosion episodes, (ii) the contributions to total bank retreat made by specific fluvial erosion and mass-wasting processes, and (iii) the causes of retreat. The results show that the occurrence of bank erosion processes (fluvial erosion, slide failure, cantilever failure) and their relative dominance differ significantly for each event, depending on seasonal hydrological conditions and initial bank geometry. Due to the specific planimetric configuration of the study bend, which steers the core of high velocity fluid away from the bank at higher flow discharges, fluvial erosion tends to occur during particular phases of the hydrograph. As a result fluvial erosion is ineffective at higher peak discharges, and depends more on the duration of more moderate discharges. Slide failures appear to be closely related to the magnitude of peak river stages, typically occurring in close proximity to the peak phase (preferentially during the falling limb, but in some cases even before the peak), while cantilever failures more typically occur in the late phase of the flow hydrograph, when they may be induced by the cumulative effects of any fluvial erosion.

  abstract = {European countries have defined {$>$}1000 national river types and {$>$}400 national lake types to implement the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). In addition, common river and lake types have been defined within regions of Europe for intercalibrating the national classification systems for ecological status of water bodies. However, only a low proportion of national types correspond to these common intercalibration types. This causes uncertainty concerning whether the classification of ecological status is consistent across countries. Therefore, through an extensive dialogue with and data provision from all EU countries, we have developed a generic typology for European rivers and lakes. This new broad typology reflects the natural variability in the most commonly used environmental type descriptors: altitude, size and geology, as well as mean depth for lakes. These broad types capture 60{\textendash}70\% of all national WFD types including almost 80\% of all European river and lake water bodies in almost all EU countries and can also be linked to all the common intercalibration types. The typology provides a new framework for large-scale assessments across country borders, as demonstrated with an assessment of ecological status and pressures based on European data from the 2nd set of river basin management plans. The typology can also be used for a variety of other large-scale assessments, such as reviewing and linking the water body types to habitat types under the Habitats Directive and the European Nature Information System (EUNIS), as well as comparing type-specific limit values for nutrients and other supporting quality elements across countries. Thus, the broad typology can build the basis for all scientific outputs of managerial relevance related to water body types.},

  abstract = {An investigation was conducted to evaluate strengths and limitations of manual calibration and the existing autocalibration tool in the watershed-scale model referred to as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Performance of the model was tested on the Little River Experimental Watershed in Georgia and the Little Washita River Experimental Watershed in Oklahoma, both USDA-ARS watersheds. A long record of multi-gauge streamflow data on each of the watersheds was used for model calibration and validation. Model performance of the streamflow response in SWAT was assessed using a six-parameter manual calibration based on daily mass balance and visual inspection of hydrographs and duration of daily flow curves, a six-parameter autocalibration method based on the daily sum of squares of the residuals after ranking objective function (referred to as SSQRauto6), a six-parameter method based on the daily sum of squares of residuals (SSQauto6), and an eleven-parameter method based on the daily sum of square of residuals (SSQauto11). Results show that for both watersheds, manual calibration generally outperformed the autocalibration methods based on percent bias (PBIAS) and simulation of the range in magnitude of daily flows. For the calibration period on Little River subwatershed F, PBIAS was 0.0\%, -24.0\%, -21.5\%, and +29.0\% for the manual, SSQRauto6, SSQauto6, and SSQauto11 methods, respectively. Based on the coefficient of efficiency (NSE), the SSQauto6 and SSQauto11 methods gave substantially better results than manual calibration on the Little River watershed. On the Little Washita watershed, however, the manual approach generally outperformed the automated methods, based on the NSE error statistic. Results of this study suggest that the autocalibration option in SWAT provides a powerful, labor-saving tool that can be used to substantially reduce the frustration and uncertainty that often characterize manual calibrations. If used in combination with a manual approach, the autocalibration tool shows promising results in providing initial estimates for model parameters. To maintain mass balance and adequately represent the range in magnitude of output variables, manual adjustments may be necessary following autocalibration. Caution must also be exercised in utilizing the autocalibration tool so that the selection of initial lower and upper ranges in the parameters results in calibrated values that are representative of watershed conditions.},

We make the surprising observation that performing a single large time step with n constraint solver iterations is less effective than computing n smaller time steps, each with a single constraint solver iteration. Based on this observation, our approach is to split every visual time step into n substeps of length {$\Delta$}t/n and to perform a single iteration of extended position-based dynamics (XPBD) in each such substep. When compared to a traditional implicit integrator with large time steps we find constraint error and damping are significantly reduced. When compared to an explicit integrator we find that our method is more stable and robust for a wider range of stiffness parameters. This result holds even when compared against more sophisticated implicit solvers based on Krylov methods. Our method is straightforward to implement, and is not sensitive to matrix conditioning nor is it to overconstrained problems.},

To explain variations in the strength of the weathering feedback, we present a model for silicate weathering that regulates climatic and tectonic forcing through hydrologic processes and imposes a thermodynamic limit on weathering fluxes, based on the physical and chemical properties of river basins. Climate regulation by silicate weathering is thus strongest when global topography is elevated, similar to the situation today, and lowest when global topography is more subdued, allowing planetary temperatures to vary depending on the global distribution of topography and mountain belts, even in the absence of appreciable changes in CO2 degassing rates.}

  abstract = {Any project using a model should include a calibration phase. For a 1D hydrodynamic model based on Saint-Venant's equations, this often means adjusting roughness coefficients, discharge coefficients at cross and lateral devices, and seepage. Several methods are described in the literature, based on minimization approaches. Whatever algorithm selected, there is nevertheless an important question to address first, which is seldom studied in the literature: "is it possible to identify the parameters I want from the measurements I have?" This first question is linked to what is called "sensitivity". This depends on the relationship between parameters and outputs of the model, but also on the desired precision on the parameters and on the available one on the measurements. Some people introduced the concept of "equifinality" stating that, in some cases, several different sets of parameters give the same model outputs within given uncertainties. This concept is somehow peculiar in the sense that it is used to criticize the model itself, whereas it may also be attached to the set of data used for the calibration. An important question is therefore "what type of input scenario would be best to be able to calibrate the model?" This second question can be addressed under some assumptions using the "worst-case" concept. The paper provides methodologies for answering these 2 questions, and is applied to an example taken from the literature. This shows that having a minimization algorithm is maybe useful, but being able to answer the 2 above questions is even more important.},

Few studies have analyzed reliable calibration methods of highly detailed rainfall-runoff models at the subcatchment level. This research presents calibration of the storm water management model version 5 (SWMM5) using high temporal resolution rainfall and flow data to perform a 10-month continuous simulation on a physically distributed urban catchment. Detailed analyses of parameters that physically represent the area in the SWMM5 model were done using remote sensing and geographical information systems techniques. Parallel computing and a multi-search driver were implemented along with a modelindependent parameter estimation (PEST) method, to find global optima and accelerate the calibration process. PEST internal settings were tuned for the continuous SWMM5 estimation problem using one month of rainfall data. Subsequently, parameter calibration was carried out with 10 months of rainfall data and model validation was performed with 5 months of data. The overall calibration and validation of the SWMM5 model was good with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient greater than 0.5 and a total volume runoff error of less than 5\%. Time offset bias from the rainfall data affected negatively the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency because of highly variable storm cells. This study shows it is possible to reproduce accurately the urban runoff from a highly detailed, semidistributed SWMM5 model, even when the calibration process is restricted to physical parameters and not allowed to distort the geometric representation of the project area.

  abstract = {The behavior of turbulent open channel flows over permeable surfaces is not well understood. In particular, it is not clear how the surface and the subsurface flow within the permeable bed interact and influence each other. In order to clarify this issue we carried out two sets of experiments, one involving velocity measurements in open channel flows over an impermeable bed composed of a single layer of spheres, and another one where velocities were measured over and within a permeable bed made of five such layers. Comparison of surface flow velocity statistics between the two sets of experiments confirmed that bed permeability can significantly affect flow resistance. It was also confirmed that even in the hydraulically rough regime, the friction factors for the permeable bed increase with increasing Reynolds number. Such an increase in flow resistance implies a different distribution of normal form-induced stress between the permeable and impermeable bed cases. Subsurface flow measurements performed within the permeable bed revealed that there is an intense transport of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) occurring from the surface to the subsurface flow. We provide evidence that the transport of TKE toward the lower bed levels is driven mainly by pressure fluctuations, whereas TKE transport due to turbulent velocity fluctuations is limited to a thinner layer placed in the upper part of the bed. It was also confirmed that the turbulence imposed by the surface flow gradually dissipates while penetrating within the porous medium. Dissipation occurs faster for the small scales than for the large ones, which instead are persistent, although weak, even at the lowest bed levels.}

One area suffering large-scale flooding was at Yuba City, at the confluence of the Feather and Yuba Rivers. The levees broke and consequent damage was in the magnitude of \$65 million. Property-owners sought recompense through suits brought in the Superior Court of Sutter County against the State of California, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG\&E), and North American Weather Consultants (NAWC). PG\&E, through its contracting agent, NAWC, had undertaken cloud seeding operations in three places in the high Sierras, one of which was in the Lake Almanor water-shed in the Feather River system. NAWC had interrupted seeding activities in that area three days before the levees broke at Yuba City. Plaintiffs charged that PG\&E and NAWC were negligent in the operation of their generators, had contributed to the total quantity of water produced by the watershed and therefore were legally liable, and that cloud seeding was ultra-hazardous activity so that those engaged in such activities were strictly liable for damages. The suit was begun in 1958 and concluded in 1964. Trial before a judge only began in October 1963 and a decision was rendered in April 1964. The judge ruled that neither PG\&E nor NAWC was liable. In accordance with an agreement among the parties no appeal was taken. Plaintiffs were successful, however, against the State, basing their claim for damages on the doctrine of inverse condemnation which holds that the State must recompense for damages incurred in the lawful exercise of its powers{\textemdash}in this case, the construction of levees. The litigation raises important questions of public policy with regard to weather modification and these are considered in the light of this case.},

  abstract = {When natural muds become mixed with sandy sediments in estuaries, it has a direct effect on the flocculation process and resultant sediment transport regime. Much research has been completed on the erosion and consolidation of mud/sand mixtures, but very little is known quantitatively about how mixed sediments interact whilst in suspension, particularly in terms of flocculation. This paper presents the settling velocity findings from a recent laboratory study which examined the flocculation dynamics for three different mud/sand mixtures at different concentrations (0.2{\textendash}5~g.l-1) and turbulent shear stresses (0.06{\textendash}0.9~Pa) in a mini-annular flume. The low intrusive video-based Laboratory Spectral Flocculation Characteristics instrument was used to determine floc/aggregate properties (e.g., size, settling velocity, density and mass) for each population. Settling data was assessed in terms of macrofloc ({$>$}160~{$\mu$}m) and microfloc ({$<$}160~{$\mu$}m) settling parameters: Wsmacro and Wsmicro, respectively. For pure muds, the macroflocs are regarded as the most dominant contributors to the total depositional flux. The parameterised settling data indicates that by adding more sand to a mud/sand mixture, the fall velocity of the macrofloc fraction slows and the settling velocity of microflocs quickens. Generally, a mainly sandy suspension comprising 25\% mud and 75\% sand (25M:75S), will produce resultant Wsmacro which are slower than Wsmicro. The quickest Wsmicro appears to consistently occur at a higher level of turbulent shear stress ({$\tau$}\,{$\sim$}\,0.6~Pa) than both the macrofloc and microfloc fractions from suspensions of pure natural muds. Flocculation within a more cohesively dominant muddy-sand suspension (i.e., 75M:25S) produced macroflocs which fell at similar speeds ({$\pm$}10\%) to pure mud suspensions at both low (200~mg~l-1) and intermediate (1~g\,l-1) concentrations at all shear stress increments. Also, low sand content suspensions produced Wsmacro values that were faster than the Wsmicro rates. In summary, the experimental results of the macrofloc and microfloc settling velocities have demonstrated that flocculation is an extremely important factor with regards to the depositional behaviour of mud/sand mixtures, and these factors must be considered when modelling mixed sediment transport in the estuarine or marine environment.},

  abstract = {Field measurements of sediment transport in gravel bed rivers often reveal hysteretic effects due to differences in sediment availability between the rising and falling limbs of a flood hydrograph. However, only a small number of flume studies have analyzed the dynamics of sediment transport during hydrographs. Three types of stepped hydrographs with contrasting durations and magnitudes are simulated here under sediment recirculation conditions. Bed load transport rate and grain size have been measured continuously. The dynamic behavior of the surface armor layer has been explored by analyzing digital photographs and laser scanner surveys of the bed surface taken during hydrographs. The results indicate that sediment transport during the falling limb was lower than during the rising limb in all of the three types of hydrographs. This reduction is more evident for the low-magnitude hydrographs. The grain size of the bed remained virtually constant throughout the hydrographs but the grain size of transported sediments exhibited a counterclockwise hysteresis. Also, a significant increase in the reference shear stress for sediment entrainment was measured during the falling limb of hydrographs. Additionally, a detailed analysis of partial transport dynamics of the bed surface sediments reveals a reduction in sediment mobility during the falling limb of the hydrographs. The difference in sediment entrainment and transport before and after the peak of the hydrographs appears to be caused by a change in the organization of the surface sediments. An analysis of detailed laser scan bed surveys reveals a phase of bed restructuring (lower vertical roughness, clast rearrangement) during the falling limb of hydrographs. Consequently, changes in the degree of organization and complexity of the bed surface are likely the cause of the reduced mobility of sediments, and thus of the reduced sediment transport rate, during the falling limb of the hydrographs.},

  abstract = {Sediment transport during flood events often reveals hysteretic patterns because flow discharge can peak before (counterclockwise hysteresis) or after (clockwise hysteresis) the peak of bedload. Hysteresis in sediment transport has been used in the literature to infer the degree of sediment availability. Counterclockwise and clockwise hysteresis have been in fact interpreted as limited and unlimited sediment supply conditions, respectively. Hysteresis has been mainly explored for the case of suspended sediment transport, but it was rarely reported for bedload transport in mountain streams. This work focuses on the temporal variability of bedload transport in an alpine catchment (Saldur basin, 18.6 km2, Italian Alps) where bedload transport was monitored by means of an acoustic pipe sensor which detects the acoustic vibrations induced by particles hitting a 0.5m-long steel pipe. Runoff dynamics are dominated by snowmelt in late spring/early summer, mostly by glacier melt in late summer/early autumn, and by a combination of the snow and glacier melt in mid-summer. The results indicate that hysteretic patterns during daily discharge fluctuations are predominantly clockwise during the snowmelt period, likely due to the ready availability of unpacked sediments within the channel or through bank erosion in the lower part of the basin. On the contrary, counterclockwise hysteresis tend to be more frequent during late glacier melting period, possibly due to the time lag needed for sediment provided by the glacial and peri-glacial area to be transported to the monitoring section. However, intense rainfall events occurring during the glacier melt period generated predominantly clockwise hysteresis, thus indicating the activation of different sediment sources. These results indicate that runoff generation processes play a crucial role on sediment supply and temporal availability in mountain streams.},

Maximum likelihood supervised classification using principal component images provided overall classification accuracies for in-stream habitats (glides, riffles, pools, and eddy drop zones) ranging from 69\% for third-order streams to 86\% for fifth-order streams. This scale dependency of classification accuracy was probably driven by the greater proportion of transitional boundary areas in the smaller streams. Multiple regressions of measured depths (y) versus principal component scores (x1, x2,{\dots}, xn) generated R2 values ranging from 67\% for high-gradient riffles to 99\% for glides in a fifth-order reach. R2 values were lower in third-order reaches, ranging from 28\% for runs and glides to 94\% for pools. The less accurate depth estimates obtained for smaller streams probably resulted from the relative increase in the number of mixed pixels, where a wide range of depths and surface turbulence occurred within a single pixel. Matched filter (MF) mapping of woody debris generated overall accuracies of 83\% in the fifth-order Lamar River. Accuracy figures for the in-stream habitat and wood mapping may have been misleadingly low because the fine-resolution imagery captured fine-scale variations not mapped by field teams, which in turn generated false ``misclassifications'' when the image and field maps were compared. The use of high spatial resolution hyperspectral (HSRH) imagery for stream mapping is limited by the need for clear water to measure depth, by any tree cover obscuring the stream, and by the limited availability of airborne hyperspectral sensors. Nonetheless, the high accuracies achieved in northern Yellowstone streams indicate that HSRH imagery can be a powerful tool for watershed-wide mapping, monitoring, and modeling of streams.},

  abstract = {The difficulties associated with using classical mathematical programming methods on complex optimization problems have contributed to the development of alternative and efficient numerical approaches. Recently, to overcome the limitations of classical optimization methods, researchers have proposed a wide variety of meta-heuristics for searching near-optimum solutions to problems. Among the existing meta-heuristic algorithms, a relatively new optimization paradigm is the Shuffled Complex Evolution at the University of Arizona (SCE-UA) which is a global optimization strategy that combines concepts of the competition evolution theory, downhill simplex procedure of Nelder{\textendash}Mead, controlled random search and complex shuffling. In an attempt to reduce processing time and improve the quality of solutions, particularly to avoid being trapped in local optima, in this paper is proposed a hybrid SCEUA approach. The proposed hybrid algorithm is the combination of SCE-UA (without Nelder{\textendash}Mead downhill simplex procedure) and a pattern search approach, called SCE-PS, for unconstrained optimization. Pattern search methods are derivative-free, meaning that they do not use explicit or approximate derivatives. Moreover, pattern search algorithms are direct search methods well suitable for the global optimization of highly nonlinear, multiparameter, and multimodal objective functions. The proposed SCE-PS method is tested with six benchmark optimization problems. Simulation results show that the proposed SCE-PS improves the searching performance when compared with the classical SCE-UA and a genetic algorithm with floating-point representation for all the tested problems. As evidenced by the performance indices based on the mean performance of objective function in 30 runs and mean of computational time, the SCE-PS algorithm has demonstrated to be effective and efficient at locating best-practice optimal solutions for unconstrained optimization.},

  abstract = {Relationships between invertebrates, substrate characteristics and trophic factors were investigated, with special emphasis on the hyporheic habitat, in order to characterize the functioning of different running waters ecosystems. Three contrasting study sites were chosen in catchments exhibiting different features: (1) a meandering reach of the Loire River in its alluvial floodplain, upstream of the `Bec d'Allier'; (2) a reach of the Galaure with a fairly developed riparian corridor, a small sinuous foothill river; and (3) a braided reach of the Drac, an alpine torrential stream. Each site was sampled once using the freezing-core technique with previous electro-positioning of the invertebrates. In each site, four 60 cm cores were extracted, each one from different morphodynamic units. In the Loire and Galaure rivers, most invertebrates are found in the first 15 cm of the sediment, with the exception of some particular taxa or morphodynamic units (riffle head). Conversely, in the Drac lotic units, maximum density of invertebrates occurs between 15 and 30 cm and more than 75 per cent of all organisms are found at a depth {$>$} 15 cm. The vertical distribution of organisms does not follow a uniform pattern in different streams. In the substrate, the vertical distribution of macroinvertebrates is very closely related to porosity in contrast with trophic parameters that always decrease with depth. The porosity is negatively correlated with the percentage of sand in the sediment and seems to be important in determining the vertical distribution of fauna, and should be integrated in a functional typology of running waters. The trophic parameters and the structure of invertebrate community with its dominant feeding groups allow discrimination of the different sites.},

  abstract = {In the Mediterranean area land degradation phenomena are becoming more and more important due to future climate change and increasing climate variability, as highlighted in recent global assessment projects such as the ``Millennium Ecosystem Assessment'' or ``The Dialogue on Water and Climate''. Thus, there is consistent evidence that extreme events such as droughts and floods are more frequent than before. On the other hand the Mediterranean area is strongly influenced by human activities such as cultivation over hundreds of years. However, in the last decades the cultivation methods and techniques are subject to profound changes such as mechanization, use of fertilizers and pesticides, remodellation of entire hillslopes etc. This particular situation leads to, and aggravates the existing stress on land resources. As a result, land degradation and soil erosion phenomena are leading to decreasing soil productivity or the loss of fertile top soil and related water quality and quantity issues. The Centre for Soil Erosion Studies (CRES) in Grosseto, Tuscany recently started a study to identify and monitor changes of land-use in southern Tuscany, Italy. The aim of this study is to assess land degradation sensitivity by scenario analysis. As a proxi for land degradation surface wash erosion processes such as rill and interill erosion processes are chosen. These present day processes are identified by aerial photo interpretation and subsequently modelled with a simple RUSLE approach on a monthly basis. In this study boundary conditions such as future precipitation were taken from the A2 future climate scenario published by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). Moreover, current land-use was identified from aerial photographs and future land-use scenarios were developed considering ecological and socio-economical issues for present day conditions of the test area. Subsequently, the different climate and land-use scenarios were analysed to study soil erosion susceptibility on the landscape scale. The study shows that even with a decline in precipitation volume until 2070, in some months higher erosion rates occur due to higher rainfall erosivity. Furthermore, land-use changes play an important role for soil erosion susceptibility. As shown, the various scenarios can effectively reduce or enhance soil erosion.},

  abstract = {The symbiosis between rhizobia soil bacteria and legumes is facultative and initiated by nitrogen starvation of the host plant. Exchange of signal molecules between the partners leads to the formation of root nodules where bacteria are converted to nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. In this mutualistic symbiosis, the bacteria provide nitrogen sources for plant growth in return for photosynthates from the host. Depending on the host plant the symbiotic fate of bacteria can either be reversible or irreversible. In Medicago plants the bacteria undergo a host-directed multistep differentiation process culminating in the formation of elongated and branched polyploid bacteria with definitive loss of cell division ability. The plant factors are nodule-specific symbiotic peptides. About 500 of them are cysteine-rich NCR peptides produced in the infected plant cells. NCRs are targeted to the endosymbionts and the concerted action of different sets of peptides governs different stages of endosymbiont maturation. This review focuses on symbiotic plant cell development and terminal bacteroid differentiation and demonstrates the crucial roles of symbiotic peptides by showing an example of multi-target mechanism exerted by one of these symbiotic peptides.}

Hence, computationally efficient implementation and identification of the hysteresis model is needed to obtain a solution with high accuracy within a reasonable time. Many studies on hysteresis identification have been reported, but few compare different methods to identify the optimal one. In the present study, we focus on the Preisach hysteresis model combined with the Lorentz modified distribution function to describe the magnetic behavior of a fully processed nonoriented Fe{\textendash}3wt\% Si steel sheet under static excitation. Three different identification techniques are implemented and evaluated: particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithms (GAs), and nonlinear least-squares approximation based on the Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt (LM) method. We evaluate each approach with regard to the accuracy, central processing unit computation time, and repeatability of the results. All the techniques perform well in this high-nonlinearity problem. The root-mean-square error is {$<$} 3\%. However, the implementation of the GA is more complex than the PSO and LM methods. The optimized parameters are obtained in a few minutes in the case of the LM method, but a few hours are required for both the other techniques. Therefore, the LM method is the most suitable technique for the identification of Preisach hysteresis.},

  abstract = {One of the most important impacts of a future warmer climate is the projected increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events. This increasing trend in extreme rainfall is seen in both the observational record and climate model projections. However, a thorough review of the recent scientific literature paints a complex picture in which the intensification of rainfall extremes depends on a multitude of factors. While some projected rainfall indices follow the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship scaling of an {$\sim$}7\%{$\sim$}7\%{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mo form="prefix"{$>\sim<$}/mo{$><$}mn{$>$}7{$<$}/mn{$><$}mo{$>\%<$}/mo{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} increase in rainfall per 1{\textdegree}C of warming, there is substantial evidence that this scaling depends on rainfall extremes frequency, with longer return period events seeing larger increases, leading to super Clausius-Clapeyron scaling in some cases. The intensification of extreme rainfall events is now well documented at the daily scale but is less clear at the subdaily scale. In recent years, climate model simulations at a finer spatial and temporal resolution, including convection-permitting models, have provided more reliable projections of subdaily rainfall. Recent analyses indicate that rainfall scaling may also increase as a function of duration, such that shorter-duration, longer return period events will likely see the largest rainfall increases in a warmer climate. This has broad implications on the design and the use of rainfall intensity{\textendash}duration{\textendash}frequency (IDF) curves, for which both an overall increase in magnitude and a steepening can now be predicted. This paper also presents an overview of measures that have been adopted by various governing bodies to adapt IDF curves to the changing climate. Current measures vary from multiplying historical design rainfall by a simple constant percentage to modulating correction factors based on return periods and to scaling them to the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship based on projected temperature increases. All of these current measures fail to recognize a possible super Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of extreme rainfall and, perhaps more importantly, the increasing scaling toward shorter-duration rainfall and the most extreme rainfall events that will significantly impact stormwater runoff in cities and in small rural catchments. This paper discusses the remaining scientific gaps and offers technical recommendations for practitioners on how to adapt IDF curves to improve climate resilience.},

The carbon sequestration efficiency of fertilization was determined from the ratio of increased ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 to the rate of phosphate addition to the upper ocean (converted to carbon units using the C/P ratio of organic matter, 106). The model simulation produced a maximum efficiency of 78\%. However, the simulations demonstrated that changes in calcium carbon production with macronutrient fertilization could significantly reduce carbon sequestration efficiency. When calcium carbonate production increases at the same rate as export production, the carbon sequestration efficiency is reduced by 25\% when compared to a simulation where calcium carbonate production is held constant. The study also discusses several other potential process that could impact the efficiency phosphate fertilization to sequester carbon in the ocean and the potential consequences of large-scale macronutrient fertilization of the ocean.},

  abstract = {Sediment transport in mountain streams can be a major hazard to downstream infrastructure. Consequently, sediment traps are a common feature in many high gradient streams to retain large volumes of sediment and protect settlements from major sediment transport events. Despite the wide application of these instream structures, there is little knowledge regarding the environmental and ecological effects on streams. Here, we investigated the hydromorphological effects of sediment traps on instream habitats and associated macroinvertebrate communities in four impacted and three non-impacted streams in Switzerland. Sediment traps significantly disrupted the sediment regime homogenising grain size percentiles compared to the natural stepwise downstream fining in control streams. This disruption in the sediment regime resulted in finer grain size distributions upstream of the sediment trap, and reduced substrate diversity in the sediment retention basin and just downstream of the trap. The reductions in substrate diversity resulted in an altered macroinvertebrate community composition. Further, the disconnection in sediment transport led to a lack of longitudinal correlation in macroinvertebrate communities. Refugia provision downstream of the sediment trap, and resource availability within the retention basin, were diminished, potentially reducing resilience of macroinvertebrate assemblages to instream disturbances. The effects of sediment traps were most likely localised in three of the four streams with substrate diversity recovering to comparable control values within 8 wetted widths (ca. 50~m) downstream of the trap associated with natural longitudinal fining. In contrast, ecological and environmental effects propagated downstream in one impacted stream with no recovery being evident. Sediment retention basins in the impacted streams provided a local artificially unique habitat of dynamic-braided channels. Our results indicate that sediment traps can significantly disrupt the sediment regime with important consequences for instream ecology and environmental conditions, although these effects can be system specific. Further work is needed to fully understand the effects of sediment traps in mountain streams to assist resource managers in the mitigation and future construction of these structures.},

Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images are analyzed to derive WQ parameters and vegetation properties, while the HYPE model provides hydrological variables. Timeseries of the considered variables are examined using graphical and statistical methods and correlations among the variables are computed for a five-year period (2016{\textendash}2022). The added-value of integrating earth observation derived data is demonstrated in the analysis of specific time periods or precipitation events. Significant positive correlations are found between water turbidity and hydrological parameters such as river discharge or runoff (0.55 and 0.40, respectively), while negative correlations are found between water turbidity and vegetation descriptors (-0.48 to -0.56). The possibility of having easy-to-use tools (e.g., web portal) for the analysis of multi-source data in an interactive way, facilitates the planning of hydroelectric plants management operations.},

So far, various setups of the GRA method are applied depending on specific purposes. For accurate measurements, statistical error due to radioactive decay must be considered. In addition, a careful setting of the further involved parameters such as collimator size, the distance between source and detector as well as the measuring time need to be taken into account. In this study, a method to optimize GRA measurements is presented by relating measuring time and collimator selection to the statistical error of radiation. As a result, a method for choosing the optimum collimator size and a mathematical equation for optimizing the measuring time are derived, which is helpful for planning the vertical profile measurement in terms of required time and spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {The complex process of sediment infiltration in gravel beds has been studied widely. However, the temporal behavior of sediment infiltration and its clogging has not yet been investigated sufficiently. To understand the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon, measurements of the effects of various boundary conditions are required with high spatial and temporal resolution. The nonintrusive and undisturbed gamma-ray attenuation method was applied in this study to establish a measuring scheme to detect the dynamic development of river bed clogging and to investigate the effects of fine sediments' particle-size distributions, total supplied mass, and supply rate on the sediment infiltration process. In a series of experiments, vertical profiles of infiltrated sediment masses were measured at two instants during the experiments. Then the dynamic changes of the infiltrated sediments at a specific position of the bed were investigated using continuous measurements during the experiments. The results of the measured vertical profile showed that sediment infiltration and clogging in an artificial bed matched the sediment's existing bridging criterion of the porous gravel bed. Furthermore, temporal changes occurred mainly in the upper layers. The continuous one-point measurements indicated almost real-time sediment accumulation development and proved that higher supply rates lead to an earlier start of the infiltration and rapid filling, whereas lower supply rates result in later and slower infiltration of the sediments.},

The ``trial and error'' method for calibrating the APEX model has been used very commonly in previous studies. In this study, the automatic calibration software Parameter Estimation (PEST) was combined with the conventional trial-and-error method to improve APEX calibration. The proposed Combined PEST and Trial{\textendash}Error (CPTE) approach can overcome: (i) weaknesses of ``Trial{\textendash}Error'' method in terms of tediousness and subjectivity involved in the decision to end a calibration, and (ii) drawback of PEST in that it may lead to biased simulation due to ignoring local specific condition. A case study was developed to verify the CPTE approach. The results based on APEX runoff simulation indicate that the CPTE approach greatly improved the calibration of APEX model with respect to model performance criteria. Coupling inverse modeling and trial{\textendash}error manual method can be an efficient and effective alternative in calibrating the APEX model.},

Cast skins accounted for over 30\% of the total production (G + Ex = 6.5 wW{$\cdot$}h-1). Comparison with Stenonema pulchellum, the only other mayfly for which complete energy budget information is available, showed respiration rates to be similar and assimilation and growth of Tricorythodes to be 2.9 and 5.3 times higher. However, the major distinction between the two was the high ingestion rate for Tricorythodes compared with that for Stenonema (7 wW{$\cdot$}h-1).},

Overfishing and other human influences are reducing the diversity and abundance of fish worldwide, but the ecosystem-level consequences of these changes have not been assessed quantitatively. Recycling of nutrients is one important ecosystem process that is directly influenced by fish. Fish species vary widely in the rates at which they excrete nitrogen and phosphorus; thus, altering fish communities could affect nutrient recycling. Here, we use extensive field data on nutrient recycling rates and population sizes of fish species in a Neotropical river and Lake Tanganyika, Africa, to evaluate the effects of simulated extinctions on nutrient recycling. In both of these species-rich ecosystems, recycling was dominated by relatively few species, but contributions of individual species differed between nitrogen and phosphorus. Alternative extinction scenarios produced widely divergent patterns. Loss of the species targeted by fishermen led to faster declines in nutrient recycling than extinctions in order of rarity, body size, or trophic position. However, when surviving species were allowed to increase after extinctions, these compensatory responses had strong moderating effects even after losing many species. Our results underscore the complexity of predicting the consequences of extinctions from species-rich animal communities. Nevertheless, the importance of exploited species in nutrient recycling suggests that overfishing could have particularly detrimental effects on ecosystem functioning.},

Hundreds of millions of people around the world benefit from low-cost protein, recreation, and commerce provided by freshwater fisheries, particularly in regions where alternative sources of nutrition and employment are scarce. Here, we derive a gridded global map of riverine fisheries and assess its implications for biodiversity conservation, fishery sustainability, and food security. Catches increase with river discharge and human population density, and 90\% of global catch comes from river basins with above-average stress levels. Fish richness and catches are positively but not causally correlated, revealing that fishing pressure is most intense in rivers where potential impacts on biodiversity are highest. Merging our catch analysis with nutritional and socioeconomic data, we find that freshwater fisheries provide the equivalent of all dietary animal protein for 158 million people. Poor and undernourished populations are particularly reliant on inland fisheries compared with marine or aquaculture sources. The spatial coincidence of productive freshwater fisheries and low food security highlights the critical role of rivers and lakes in providing locally sourced, low-cost protein. At the same time, intensive fishing in regions where rivers are already degraded by other stressors may undermine efforts to conserve biodiversity. This syndrome of poverty, nutritional deficiency, fishery dependence, and extrinsic threats to biodiverse river ecosystems underscores the high stakes for improving fishery management. Our enhanced spatial data on estimated catches can facilitate the inclusion of inland fisheries in environmental planning to protect both food security and species diversity.},

  abstract = {Brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis are native fish in decline owing to environmental changes. Predictions of their potential distribution and a better understanding of their relationship to habitat conditions would enhance the management and conservation of this valuable species. We used over 7,800 brook trout observations throughout New York State and georeferenced, multiscale landscape condition data to develop four regionally specific artificial neural network models to predict brook trout abundance in rivers and streams. Land cover data provided a general signature of human activity, but other habitat variables were resistant to anthropogenic changes (i.e., changing on a geological time scale). The resulting models predict the potential for any stream to support brook trout. The models were validated by holding 20\% of the data out as a test set and by comparison with additional field collections from a variety of habitat types. The models performed well, explaining more than 90\% of data variability. Errors were often associated with small spatial displacements of predicted values. When compared with the additional field collections (39 sites), 92\% of the predictions were off by only a single class from the field-observed abundances. Among ``least-disturbed'' field collection sites, all predictions were correct or off by a single abundance class, except for one where brown trout Salmo trutta were present. Other degrading factors were evident at most sites where brook trout were absent or less abundant than predicted. The most important habitat variables included landscape slope, stream and drainage network sizes, water temperature, and extent of forest cover. Predicted brook trout abundances were applied to all New York streams, providing a synoptic map of the distribution of brook trout habitat potential. These fish models set benchmarks of best potential for streams to support brook trout under broad-scale human influences and can assist with planning and identification of protection or rehabilitation sites.

Despite advances in using biological methods as a proxy, physical measures remain an important method through which fine sediment can be quantified. The aim of this study was to provide further insights into the environmental variables controlling sediment accumulation in lowland gravel bed rivers. We sampled 21 sites, during spring and autumn, selected to cover a gradient of excess fine sediment. Fine sediment was sampled using a range of methods including visual assessments, the disturbance method, and suspended sediment concentrations. A range of abiotic predictors was measured during sampling, and hydrological and antecedent flow indices were derived from local flow gauging station data. The results show reach scale visual estimates of fine sediment to be significantly and highly correlated with fully quantitative estimates of total surface sediment. Multivariate regression analysis showed that flow variables (regime, antecedent, and local flow characteristics) were strong predictors of deposited sediment metrics but poor predictors of suspended sediment. Organic content was shown to be relatively independent of total sediment quantity and is likely driven by other factors which influence the supply and breakdown of organic matter.},

  abstract = {Reliable assessments of how human activities will affect wildlife populations are essential for making scientifically defensible resource management decisions. A principle challenge of predicting effects of proposed management, development, or conservation actions is the need to incorporate multiple biotic and abiotic factors, including land-use and climate change, that interact to affect wildlife habitat and populations through time. Here we demonstrate how models of land-use, climate change, and other dynamic factors can be integrated into a coherent framework for predicting wildlife population trends. Our framework starts with land-use and climate change models developed for a region of interest. Vegetation changes through time under alternative future scenarios are predicted using an individual-based plant community model. These predictions are combined with spatially explicit animal habitat models to map changes in the distribution and quality of wildlife habitat expected under the various scenarios. Animal population responses to habitat changes and other factors are then projected using a flexible, individual-based animal population model. As an example application, we simulated animal population trends under three future land-use scenarios and four climate change scenarios in the Cascade Range of western Oregon. We chose two birds with contrasting habitat preferences for our simulations: winter wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes), which are most abundant in mature conifer forests, and song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), which prefer more open, shrubby habitats. We used climate and land-use predictions from previously published studies, as well as previously published predictions of vegetation responses using FORCLIM, an individual-based forest dynamics simulator. Vegetation predictions were integrated with other factors in PATCH, a spatially explicit, individual-based animal population simulator. Through incorporating effects of landscape history and limited dispersal, our framework predicted population changes that typically exceeded those expected based on changes in mean habitat suitability alone. Although land-use had greater impacts on habitat quality than did climate change in our simulations, we found that small changes in vital rates resulting from climate change or other stressors can have large consequences for population trajectories. The ability to integrate bottom-up demographic processes like these with top-down constraints imposed by climate and land-use in a dynamic modeling environment is a key advantage of our approach. The resulting framework should allow researchers to synthesize existing empirical evidence, and to explore complex interactions that are difficult or impossible to capture through piecemeal modeling approaches.},

Default or text-book values are therefore often used. This paper introduces a methodology to optimize hydrodynamic model parameter values, based on the use of a surrogate conceptual model. Thanks to the spatial lumping and the explicit calculation schemes of these conceptual models, very short calculation times and a large number of simulation runs can be achieved. The surrogate model is coupled with the Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis algorithm of the University of Arizona (SCEM-UA) to identify the optimal parameter sets and their uncertainty. Afterwards, the optimized parameter values are transferred to the full hydrodynamic model. The methodology is demonstrated on a case study of the river Molenbeek in Belgium, using streamflow, water level and gate level observations. Results show a decrease of the hydrodynamic model residuals by about 60 percent.},

The integration of the variational form of main flow equations with an adequate choice of test functions transforms the three-dimensional model in a two-dimensional model. The finite element method using a two-dimensional mesh is used to solve the problem. This model is stable and robust because it does not use a mesh in the vertical direction.

Complexities in process characterization arise as a consequence of the dual dependence of sediment aggregate properties on the physico-chemical properties of the sediment-water mixture as well as the turbulent flow field. Present day knowledge of the processes enables reliable predictions of rates of sedimentation and erosion in navigable channels, waterways and harbors through numerical modeling. Further research is required for improving procedures for measuring settling velocities, identification of depth at which a definable bed is encountered, and the behavior of near-bed high density suspensions.},

These projections include all major anthropogenic greenhouse gases and are a result of a multi-year effort to produce new scenarios for climate change research. We combine a suite of atmospheric concentration observations and emissions estimates for greenhouse gases (GHGs) through the historical period (1750{\textendash}2005) with harmonized emissions projected by four different Integrated Assessment Models for 2005{\textendash}2100. As concentrations are somewhat dependent on the future climate itself (due to climate feedbacks in the carbon and other gas cycles), we emulate median response characteristics of models assessed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report using the reduced-complexity carbon cycle climate model MAGICC6. Projected `best-estimate' global-mean surface temperature increases (using inter alia a climate sensitivity of 3{\textdegree}C) range from 1.5{\textdegree}C by 2100 for the lowest of the four RCPs, called both RCP3-PD and RCP2.6, to 4.5{\textdegree}C for the highest one, RCP8.5, relative to pre-industrial levels. Beyond 2100, we present the ECPs that are simple extensions of the RCPs, based on the assumption of either smoothly stabilizing concentrations or constant emissions: For example, the lower RCP2.6 pathway represents a strong mitigation scenario and is extended by assuming constant emissions after 2100 (including net negative CO2 emissions), leading to CO2 concentrations returning to 360~ppm by 2300. We also present the GHG concentrations for one supplementary extension, which illustrates the stringent emissions implications of attempting to go back to ECP4.5 concentration levels by 2250 after emissions during the 21st century followed the higher RCP6 scenario. Corresponding radiative forcing values are presented for the RCP and ECPs.},

The intersection between fluvial geomorphology and riverine ecology represents an ideal confluence to examine the contribution of the geomorphic field tradition to environmental flows, and show this area of riverine management as a research frontier for applied geomorphology. Environmental flows have consisted of a set of ecological-based stream flow guidelines designed to inform sustainable water resource management that supports healthy riverine habitats and provides sufficient water supply for society. Geomorphological understanding is central to environmental flows because it is the interaction between flow, form, and substrate that influences habitat type, condition, availability and biotic use across space and time. This relationship varies longitudinally, laterally, vertically, overtime, and across macro- to mesoscale morphologies within the riverine environment. The geomorphic template is, therefore, as integral as the flow. We reviewed studies where field evidence indicated that geomorphology impacts the effectiveness of environmental flow strategies and we make the case for the need to increase geomorphic considerations in environmental flows. Although flow is commonly referred to as the master variable in environmental flows, geomorphology mediates the effects of flow regime on ecological processes. Concepts and applications from this perspective on the role of geomorphology in riverine ecosystem research will inform the practice, policy, and implementation of environmental flows.},

  abstract = {Information on suspended sediment load is crucial to water management and environmental protection. Suspended sediment loads for three major rivers (Mississippi, Missouri and Rio Grande) in USA are estimated using artificial neural network (ANN) modeling approach. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN with an error back propagation algorithm, using historical daily and weekly hydroclimatological data (precipitation P(t), current discharge Q(t), antecedent discharge Q(t-1), and antecedent sediment load SL(t-1)), is used to predict the suspended sediment load SL(t) at the selected monitoring stations. Performance of ANN was evaluated using different combinations of input data sets, length of record for training, and temporal resolution (daily and weekly data). Results from ANN model were compared with results from multiple linear regressions (MLR), multiple non-linear regression (MNLR) and Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) using correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute percent error (MAPE) and model efficiency (E). Comparison of training period length was also made (4, 3 and 2 years of training and 1, 2 and 3 years of testing, respectively). The model efficiency (E) and R2 values were slightly higher for the 4 years of training and 1 year of testing (4*1) for Mississippi River, indifferent for Missouri and slightly lower for Rio Grande River. Daily simulations using Input 1 (P(t), Q(t), Q(t-1), SL(t-1)) and three years of training and two years of testing (3*2) performed better (R2 and E of 0.85 and 0.72, respectively) than the simulation with two years of training and three years of testing (2*3) (R2 and E of 0.64 and 0.46, respectively). ANN predicted daily values using Input 1 and 3*2 architecture for Missouri (R2=0.97) and Mississippi (R2=0.96) were better than those of Rio Grande (R2=0.65). Daily predictions were better compared to weekly predictions for all three rivers due to higher correlation within daily than weekly data. ANN predictions for most simulations were superior compared to predictions using MLR, MNLR and ARIMA. The modeling approach presented in this paper can be potentially used to reduce the frequency of costly operations for sediment measurement where hydrological data is readily available.},

In our carefully designed experiment we investigated four modeling decisions in ten nested basins: the spatial resolution of the model, the spatial representation of the forcing data, the calibration period, and the performance metric. The flood characteristics were mainly affected by the performance metric, whereas the drought characteristics were mainly affected by the calibration period. The results could be related to the processes that triggered the particular events studied. The impact of the modeling decisions on the simulations did, however, vary among the investigated sub-basins. In spite of the limitations of this study, our findings have important implications for the understanding and quantification of uncertainty in any hydrological or even environmental model. Modeling decisions during model configuration introduce subjectivity from the modeler. Multiple working hypotheses during model configuration can provide insights on the impact of such subjective modeling decisions.},

These methods generally produce similar equilibrium bed morphology, but temporal evolution can differ. The adjustment of natural rivers may be reproduced by both modes. Nevertheless, computer models of river morphodynamics typically use a sediment-feed boundary condition, which can impact the simulated evolution of transient features such as bedforms. The effect of sediment transport boundary conditions on bedform dynamics was analyzed through numerical experiments using a two-dimensional, depth-averaged sediment transport model. Two different boundary conditions were imposed at the inlet (constant sediment feed and sediment recirculated from the outlet) for two bedform scales (dunes and bars). The type of sediment transport boundary condition greatly influenced dune development. The sediment-recirculating condition produced a more dynamic bed morphology with dunes of higher amplitude. The associated zones of higher shear stress had a direct impact on the hydrodynamics and patterns of sediment transport. In the case of the bar bed morphology, the simulated bars had similar mean length and height for both sediment boundary conditions. However, the sediment-recirculating case produced a more dynamic bed, in which the dominant bar length varied over time. Finally, the simulated bed morphology with bars, agreed much better with that observed when using a calibrated sediment transport equation to match sediment discharges instead of the standard empirical sediment transport equations available in literature.},

  abstract = {Recent research concerning the evolution of rock-bed channels largely has focussed on the incision processes, often related to bulk streampower, expressed as a function of basin-scale catchment area and reach-scale channel slope. In contrast, Turowksi (this volume) draws attention to the local `tools' versus `cover' effect of often partial sediment cover within rock-bed channels and the effects on channel morphology. Herein we introduce some additional, neglected concepts with new, proposed terminology. Importantly, we emphasize the probable role of the sediment cover in maintaining dynamic equilibria in the rock-bed channel incision process. Although `bedrock-confined' channels often contain a basal sediment filament, some channels have a rock bed but alluvial banks {\textendash} here termed `bedrock-constrained' channels. In plan, some bedrock-constrained rivers exhibit alluvial, meandering behaviour superimposed as an `alluvial overprint' whereas local hard points in semi-alluvial rivers modify alluvial patterns as the `bedrock footprint'. Local hard points may also occur as stabilizing vegetation or woody debris which act in a manner similar to some engineered structures. Thus understanding of semi-alluvial channels might be enhanced by comparison with the well-researched role of the effects of engineered structures on alluvial channels.},

  abstract = {Rainfall erosivity, considering rainfall amount and intensity, is an important parameter for soil erosion risk assessment under future land use and climate change. Despite its importance, rainfall erosivity is usually implemented in models with a low spatial and temporal resolution. The purpose of this study is to assess the temporal- and spatial distribution of rainfall erosivity in form of the (Revised) Universal Soil Loss Equation R-factor for Switzerland. Time series of 22 yr for rainfall (10 min resolution) and temperature (1 h resolution) data were analysed for 71 automatic gauging stations distributed throughout Switzerland. Regression-kriging was used to interpolate the rainfall erosivity values of single stations and to generate a map for Switzerland. Latitude, longitude, average annual precipitation, biogeographic units (Jura, Midland, etc.), aspect and elevation were used as covariates, of which average annual precipitation, elevation and the biographic unit (Western Central Alps) were significant (p {$<$} 0.01) predictors. The mean value of long-term rainfall erosivity is 1330 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1 with a range of lowest values of 124 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1 at an elevated station in Grisons to highest values of 5611 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1 in Ticino. All stations have highest erosivity values from July to August and lowest values in the winter months. Swisswide the month May to October show significantly increasing trends of rainfall erosivity for the observed period (p {$<$} 0.005). Only in February a significantly decreasing trend of rainfall erosivity is found (p {$<$} 0.01). The increasing trends of rainfall erosivity in May, September and October when vegetation cover is scarce are likely to enhance soil erosion risk for certain agricultural crops and alpine grasslands in Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Understanding and defining the spatial distribution of sediment deposited in reservoirs is essential not only at the design stage but also during the operation. The majority of research concerns the distribution of sediment deposition in medium and large water reservoirs. Most empirical methods do not provide satisfactory results when applied to the determination of sediment deposition in small reservoirs. Small reservoir's volumes do not exceed 5 {\texttimes} 106 m3 and their capacity-inflow ratio is less than 10\%. Long-term silting measurements of three small reservoirs were used to evaluate the method described by Rahmanian and Banihashemi for predicting sediment distributions in small reservoirs. Rahmanian and Banihashemi stated that their model of distribution of sediment deposition in water reservoir works well for a long duration operation. In the presented study, the silting rate was used in order to determine the long duration operation. Silting rate is a quotient of volume of the sediment deposited in the reservoir and its original volume. It was stated that when the silting rate had reached 50\%, the sediment deposition in the reservoir may be described by an empirical reservoir depth shape function (RDSF).},

  abstract = {We compare the performance of three most accepted reagents for organic matter removal: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and disodium peroxodisulfate (Na2S2O8). Removal of organic matter from soil is mostly incomplete with the efficiency of removal depending on reaction conditions and sample properties. Generally, NaOCl and Na2S2O8 are more effective in organic C removal than H2O2. Alkaline conditions and additives favoring dispersion and/or desorption of organic matter, such as sodium pyrophosphate, seem to be crucial for C removal. Pyrophosphate and additives for pH control (bicarbonate) may irreversibly adsorb to mineral surfaces. In soils with a large proportion of organic matter bound to the mineral matrix, for example subsoils, or rich in clay-sized minerals (Fe oxides, poorly crystalline Fe and Al phases, expandable phyllosilicates), C removal can be little irrespective of the reagents used. Residual organic C seems to seems to represent largely refractory organic matter, and comprises mainly pyrogenic materials and aliphatic compounds. If protected by close association with minerals, other organic constituents such as low-molecular weight carboxylic acids, lignin-derived and N-containing compounds may escape chemical destruction. For determination of mineral phase properties, treatment with H2O2 should be avoided since it may promote organicassisted dissolution of poorly crystalline minerals at low pH, disintegration of expandable clay minerals, and transformation of vermiculite into mica-like products due to NH4؉ fixation. Sodium hypochlorite and Na2S2O8 are less harmful for minerals than H2O2. While the NaOCl procedure (pH 9.5) may dissolve Al hydroxides, alkaline conditions favor the precipitation of metals released upon destruction of organic matter. Prolonged heating to Ͼ40؇C during any treatment may transform poorly crystalline minerals into more crystalline ones. Sodium hypochlorite can be used at 25؇C, thus preventing heat-induced mineral alteration.},

Accordingly, the objective of this study is investigating the estimated sediment delivery by the RUSLE method and Sediment Delivery Distributed (SEDD) model. To this end, the Talar watershed in Iran was selected as the study area. Further, 700 paired sediment-discharge measurements at Valikbon and Shirgah-Talar hydrometric stations between the years 1991 and 2011 were collected and used in sediment rating curves. Nine procedures were investigated to produce the required RUSLE layers. The estimated soil erosion by RUSLE was evaluated using sediment rating curve data by two methods including least squares and quantile regression. The average annual suspended sediment load was calculated for each sub-watershed of the study area using the SEDD model. Afterwards, a sediment rating curve was estimated by least squares and quantile regression methods using paired discharge-sediment data. The average annual suspended sediment load values were calculated for two hydrometric stations and were further evaluated by the SEDD model. The results indicated that the first considered procedure, which utilized 15-min rainfall measurements for the rainfall factor (R), and the classification method of SENTINEL-2 MSI image for the cover management factor (C), offered the best results in producing RUSLE layers. Furthermore, the results revealed the advantages of utilizing satellite images in producing cover management layer, which is required in the RUSLE method.},

In Hydraulic Engineering, they refer, e.g., to stormwater basins, stabilization ponds for wastewater treatment and aquaculture tanks. Since they involve low flow velocities, a continuous settling process often affects such shallow reservoirs. Therefore, it is important to expand the knowledge about the influence of its geometry on the hydrodynamic behavior and the sedimentation tendency. This paper aims to analyze flow patterns in a rectangular reservoir with symmetrically positioned upstream and downstream channels, taking into account three different flow rates under steady flow regime (0.50, 1.25 and 3.40 L/s). Experimental tests were performed in a laboratory prototype, consisted of a 3.0 m long and 2.0 m wide reservoir, with a maximum depth of 0.30 m. Also, it was applied the WOLF 2D software for numerical modeling of all variants. Experimentally, a symmetrical hydrodynamic behavior was observed only for the lowest flow rate, while the flow pattern was asymmetrical for the other cases. On the other hand, the numerical model indicated hydrodynamic symmetry for all scenarios.},

  abstract = {A continuation method has been used with a {\"y}nite element grid and a geometric perturbation to compute two successive symmetry breaking ow transitions with increasing Reynolds number in ow of generalized Newtonian uids through a sudden planar expansion. With an expansion ratio of 16, the onset Reynolds number is particularly sensitive to small geometric asymmetry and the critical Reynolds numbers for the two successive ow transitions are found to be very close. These transitions are delayed to higher onset Reynolds numbers by increasing the degree of pseudoplasticity. This trend is observed experimentally as well in this work and may be attributed to the competing e ects of shear thinning and inertia on the size of the corner vortex before the symmetry breaking ow transition. After the second transition with an expansion ratio of 16, the two large staggered vortices on opposite walls occupy most of the transverse dimension so that the core ow between the vortices appears as a thin jet oscillating along the ow direction. This is more pronounced for the pseudoplastic liquid. After the second transition, the degree of ow asymmetry at a given location downstream of the expansion plane is larger for the pseudoplastic liquid than for the Newtonian liquid at comparable Reynolds numbers.

Flow regimes have been modified by anthropogenic interventions and climate change is expected to cause additional impacts by altering precipitation extremes. This study aims to evaluate the observed hydrologic alteration caused by dam construction and simulate alteration due to expected climatic changes in a monsoon dominated mesoscale river basin in India. To analyze the natural flow regime, 15 years of observed streamflow (1950{\textendash}1965) prior to dam construction is used. Future flow regime is simulated by a validated hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), using four high resolution ({$\sim$}25km) Regional Climate Model (RCM) outputs for the near future (2021{\textendash}2050) based on the SRES A1B scenario. Finally, to quantify the hydrological alterations of different flow characteristics, the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) method which is based on the Range of Variability approach is used. This approach enables the assessment of ecologically sensitive streamflow parameters for the pre- and post-impact periods. Results of our analysis indicate that flow variability in the river has been significantly reduced due to dam construction with high flows being reduced and low flows during non-monsoon months considerably enhanced. Streamflow simulated based on projected climatic changes reveals reduced monsoonal flows with marginal changes in non-monsoon streamflow. The combined effect will reduce flow variability, potentially affecting the ecosystem. We conclude that in such modified basins, adaptive river basin management will be necessary to maintain such an extreme river flow regime for the long term viability of riverine ecosystems.},

Results show the relationship between the reattachment length and the flow Reynolds number and expansion ratio. Correlations are developed for the nondimensional reattachment length and the maximum velocity magnitude in the reverse-flow region in terms of Reynolds numbers and expansion ratios. The correlations and computed results achieve excellent agreement with published literature. Bifurcation phenomena resulting in the loss of flow symmetry downstream of the sudden expansion is observed and critical Reynolds numbers for the onset of bifurcation for various expansion ratios are identified. The initiation mechanism for bifurcation is attributed to the amplification of streamwise velocity disturbances at a spatial location that depends on the flow Reynolds number. For Reynolds numbers near the critical value for bifurcation onset, the disturbances grow from the sudden expansion, while for Reynolds numbers well above the critical value, the disturbances grow from the location of flow reattachment that occurred in the symmetric condition prior to bifurcation. Finally, the effect of the bifurcation phenomena on the development of flow unsteadiness and transition to turbulence downstream of the sudden expansion is linked to the successive formation of smaller-scale, steady recirculation zones. Transition is initiated by inviscid instability of the inflectional velocity profiles associated with these smaller-scale zones.},

The submerged and nonsubmerged spur dikes were modeled at different locations in the bend using the numerical model. Based on the dikes' location and submergence, different scour holes on the channel bed were formed. For all models, the maximum secondary flow power occurs at the upstream of the first spur dike and the maximum sedimentation occurs at the end of the inner bank. The maximum scour depth generally occurs at the tip of the first dike wing. The space between the spur dikes should not be more than 5 times of the dike length. In the submerged mode, the maximum scour depth decreased to 22\% compared to the non-submerged mode one. Moreover, the location of sedimentation is a little further away from the bend end.},

Dynamic Cone Penetration (DCP) test is one of the most versatile amongst them. In the present research, a light weight simple DCP device was developed and used for evaluation of the engineering properties of sandy soils in laboratory conditions. The device consisted of an 8-kg hammer that drops over a height of 575~mm, and drives a 60{\textdegree} cone tip with 20~mm base diameter into the ground. To control the validation of the results, laboratory direct shear and plate load tests were used as reference tests. The soil sample was a poorly graded sandy soil (SP) taken from alluvial deposits of the Tehran plain. All DCP tests and PLTs were undertaken on compacted soil in a mould with 700 mm diameter and 700 mm height. Based on the results of the experiments, the relationships between Dynamic Penetration Index (DPI), relative density (Dr), modulus of elasticity (E), shear modulus (G), modulus of subgrade reaction (KS), and the friction angle of the soil were obtained with a high coefficient of determination ({$>$}90\%). The repeatability of the test results was also evaluated by calculating the coefficient of variations (Cv), which was less than 30\% for all tests.},

Modelers lack objective guidance of how to select the most appropriate one for a specific application. Such guidance can be provided by Bayesian model selection (BMS). Its applicability is however limited by high computational costs. To transfer it to computationally expensive river modeling tasks, we propose to combine BMS with model reduction based on arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Expansion. To account for approximation errors in the reduced models, we introduce a novel correction factor that yields a reliable model ranking even under strong computational time constraints. We demonstrate our proposed approach on a case study for a 10-km stretch of the lower Rhine river. The correction factor may shield us from misleading model ranking results. In our case, the correction factor was shown to increase the confidence in model selection.},

Particularly among land plants, N2-fixing symbionts occur in a variety of distantly related plant lineages and often involve an intimate association between host and symbiont2,4. Descriptions of such intimate symbioses are lacking for seagrasses, which evolved around~100\,million years ago from terrestrial flowering plants that migrated back to the sea5. Here we describe an N2-fixing symbiont, `Candidatus Celerinatantimonas neptuna', that lives inside seagrass root tissue, where it provides ammonia and amino acids to its host in exchange for sugars. As such, this symbiosis is reminiscent of terrestrial N2-fixing plant symbioses. The symbiosis between Ca. C. neptuna and its host Posidonia oceanica enables highly productive seagrass meadows to thrive in the nitrogen-limited Mediterranean Sea. Relatives of Ca. C. neptuna occur worldwide in coastal ecosystems, in which they may form similar symbioses with other seagrasses and saltmarsh plants. Just like N2-fixing microorganisms might have aided the colonization of nitrogen-poor soils by early land plants6, the ancestors of Ca. C. neptuna and its relatives probably enabled flowering plants to invade nitrogen-poor marine habitats, where they formed extremely efficient blue carbon ecosystems7.},

Given the complex nature of soils, a suitable and efficient method for standardized microplastic analysis in the soil matrix has yet to be found. This paper proposes a critical review on the different published methods for sampling, extraction, purification, and identification/quantification of microplastics in complex environmental matrices, with the main focus on their applicability for soil samples. While large microplastic particles can be manually sorted out and verified with chemical analysis, sample preparation for smaller microplastic analysis is usually more difficult. Of the analytical approaches proposed in the literature, some are established, whereas others are a proof of principle and have not yet been applied to environmental samples. For the sake of development, all approaches are discussed and assessed for their potential applicability for soil samples. So far, none of the published methods seems ideally suitable for the analysis of smaller microplastics in soil samples, but slight modifications and combinations of methods may prove promising and need to be explored.},

  abstract = {Microplastic pollution in soils is an emerging topic in the scientific community, with researchers striving to determine the occurrence and the impact of microplastics on soil health, ecology, and functionality. However, information on the microplastic contamination of soils is limited because of a lack of suitable analytical methods. Because micro-Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy ({\textmu}-FTIR), next to Raman spectroscopy, is one of the few methods that allows the determination of the number, polymer type, shape, and size of microplastic particles, the present study addresses the challenge of purifying soil samples sufficiently to allow a subsequent {\textmu}-FTIR analysis. A combination of freeze-drying, sieving, density separation, and a sequential enzymatic-oxidative digestion protocol enables removal of the mineral mass ({$>$}99.9\% dry wt) and an average reduction of 77\% dry weight of the remaining organic fraction. In addition to visual integrity, attenuated total reflectance FTIR, gel permeation chromatography, and differential scanning calorimetry showed that polyamide, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyvinyl chloride in the size range of 100 to 400 {\textmu}m were not affected by the approach. However, biodegradable polylactic acid showed visible signs of degradation and reduced molecular weight distribution after protease treatment. Nevertheless, the presented purification protocol is a reliable and robust method to purify relatively large soil samples of approximately 250 g dry weight for spectroscopic analysis in microplastic research and has been shown to recover various microplastic fibers and fragments down to a size of 10 {\textmu}m from natural soil samples.

The model uses boundary-fitted coordinates, includes effective stresses, and may be used to analyze sub- and supercritical flows. The time differencing is accomplished using a second-order accurate Beam and Warming approximation, while the spatial derivatives are approximated by second-order accurate central differencing. The equations are solved on a nonstaggered grid using an aItemating-direction-implicit scheme. To enhance applicability, the equations are solved in transformed computational coordinates. The effective stresses are modeled by incorporating a constant eddy-viscosity turbulence model to approximate the turbulent Reynolds stresses. As is customary, the stresses due to depth-averaging are neglected. Excluding recirculating flows, it is observed that in most cases the effective stresses do not significantly affect the converged solution. The model is used to analyze a wide variety of hydraulics problems including flow in a channel with a hydraulic jump, flow in a channel contraction, flow near a spur-dike, flow in a 1800 channel bend, and a dam-break simulation. For each of these cases, the computed results are compared with experimental data. The agreement between the computed and experimental results is satisfactory.},

This study was designed to compare USLE calculations in a GIS environment at grid sizes ranging from 30{\texttimes}30m up to 6{\texttimes}6km. The analysis of two watersheds in Mississippi shows that large grid sizes tend to underestimate soil losses. At grid sizes exceeding 100{\texttimes}100m, a correction factor must be included in the calculations. With the use of the correction factor, the USLE can be applied directly at macroscales, providing an important tool for studies of basin-wide upland erosion rates.

The resulting equations are very similar to the equations constructed for Riemann solutions of compressible gas dynamics. In particular the artificial viscosity is analogous to terms constructed from signal velocities and jumps in variables across characteristics. When applied to shock tubes, blast waves, wall shocks, and the Roberts and Sj{\"o}green problems the new equations give very good results. They also provide the basis for the generalization of SPH to relativistic flows.}

The classic configuration is due to Scott Russell who used the sinking box in 1844 to illustrate the formation of a solitary wave in a long rectangular tank. We use a combination of computer simulation and experiment to clarify details of the wave formation and the dynamics of the sinking box. We find that as the box sinks the water is heaved up to form both the solitary wave and a reverse plunging wave which forms a vortex. This vortex follows the wave down the tank. The computer simulation uses the particle method smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) which allows us to follow the formation of the waves and the dynamics of the box. The simulation results are in satisfactory agreement with the experiments. We derive scaling relations for the velocity of the box and for the amplitude of the solitary wave. These scaling relations are in reasonable agreement with the experiments and the simulations.}

The alpha model involves two velocity fields. One velocity field is obtained from the momentum equation, the other by averaging this velocity field as in the version of SPH called XSPH. The particles (fluid elements) are moved with the averaged velocity. In analogy to the continuum alpha model we obtain a particle Lagrangian from which the SPH alpha equations can be derived. The system satisfies a discrete Kelvin circulation theorem identical to that obtained with no velocity averaging. In addition, the energy, linear and angular momentum are conserved. We show that the continuum equivalent of the SPH equations are identical to the continuum alpha model, and we conjecture that they will have the same desirable features of the continuum model including the reduction of energy in the high-wavenumber modes even when the dissipation is zero. Regardless of issues concerning turbulence modelling, the SPH alpha model is a powerful extension of the XSPH algorithm, which reduces disorder at short length-scales and retains the constants of the motion. The SPH alpha model is simple to implement.}

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with approximating arbitrarily shaped boundaries in SPH simulations. We model the boundaries by means of boundary particles which exert forces on a fluid. We show that, when these forces are chosen correctly, and the boundary particle spacing is a factor of 2 (or more) less than the fluid particle spacing, the total boundary force on a fluid SPH particle is perpendicular to boundaries with negligible error. Furthermore, the variation in the force as a fluid particle moves, while keeping a fixed distance from the boundary, is also negligible. The method works equally well for convex or concave boundaries. The new boundary forces simplify SPH algorithms and are superior to other methods for simulating complicated boundaries. We apply the new method to (a) the rise of a cylinder contained in a curved basin, (b) the spin down of a fluid in a cylinder, and (c) the oscillation of a cylinder inside a larger fixed cylinder. The results of the simulations are in good agreement with those obtained using other methods, but with the advantage that they are very simple to implement.},

  abstract = {Microhabitat suitability models are commonly used to estimate salmonid habitat abundance and quality with unknown accuracy or reliability. When tested, the metrics used to evaluate these models are often limited by the methods used to develop them. More generalized bioverification strategies that transcend methodology are therefore needed in ecohydraulics. This study further developed and applied such a generalized bioverification framework to four approximately 1-m-resolution rearing salmonid microhabitat suitability models. Water depth and velocity habitat suitability criteria (HSC) functions were developed for two size classes of rearing Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and O. mykiss using snorkel survey data collected over three years at seven sites along the lower Yuba River in California, USA. An expert-based cover HSC function was modified from previous studies. HSC functions were applied to previously validated, approximately 1-m-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamic models and cover maps of the river. Mann{\textendash}Whitney U tests confirmed that suitability values were significantly higher at utilized locations compared to randomly generated, non-utilized locations for all four models. Bootstrapped forage ratios demonstrated that microhabitat suitability models accurately predicted both preferred and avoided habitat beyond the 95\% confidence level. This generalized bioverification framework is recommended for evaluating and comparing the accuracy and reliability of ecohydraulic models used in habitat management worldwide.}

  abstract = {Relationships between fluvial aquatic habitat availability and discharge are often assumed to remain static when used with hydrologic datasets to analyze changes in habitat availability over time. Despite this assumption, studies have observed significant changes in aquatic habitat availability before and after restoration projects, dam removals, and extreme flood events. However, research is lacking on how aquatic habitat changes as a result of morphodynamic processes during more commonly occurring hydrologic conditions. This study compared Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) rearing habitat availability at 19 discharges before and after a relatively mild 8-year hydrologic period punctuated with modest floods on the lower Yuba River in California, USA. During this time, the total area of rearing habitat remained relatively consistent at discharges {$<$}2{\texttimes} bankfull but decreased by up to 25\% at discharges {$>$}2{\texttimes} bankfull. Significant decreases in rearing habitat area appeared to be the result of widespread erosion on floodplains, terraces, and lateral bars, even after only modest floods. As a result, spatially delineated areas of lost habitat tended to increase in water depth and velocity at baseflow, bankfull, and floodplain-filling discharges, while areas of gained habitat decreased in depth and velocity. Although these specific results may not apply to all rivers around the world, the finding that habitat{\textendash}discharge relationships change as a result of morphodynamic processes likely does transfer globally and should be considered when making long-term regulatory and management decisions, such as instream flow requirements and habitat restoration plans.},

In order to realize the promise of ML-based potentials, systematic and scalable approaches to generate diverse training sets need to be developed. This work creates a diverse training set for tungsten in an automated manner using an entropy optimization approach. Subsequently, multiple polynomial and neural network potentials are trained on the entropy-optimized dataset. A corresponding set of potentials are trained on an expert-curated dataset for tungsten for comparison. The models trained to the entropy-optimized data exhibited superior transferability compared to the expert-curated models. Furthermore, the models trained to the expert-curated set exhibited a significant decrease in performance when evaluated on out-of-sample configurations.},

Here we present a study aimed at quantifying exchange between suspensions of clay and gravel beds. The questions that motivate the work are: how do bed roughness and pore space characteristics, shear velocity ( ), and initial concentration (C0) affect clay deposition on or within gravel beds? Where does deposition within these beds occur, and can deposited clay be resuspended while the gravel is immobile? We examine these questions in a laboratory flume using acrylic, open-framework gravel, and armored sand-gravel beds under conditions of varying and C0. Deposition of clay occurred to all beds (even with Rouse numbers {$\sim$} 0.01). We attribute deposition under full suspension conditions to be an outcome of localized protected zones where clay can settle and available pore space in the bed. For smooth wall cases, protection came from the viscous wall region and the development of bed forms; for the rough beds, protection came from separation zones and low-velocity pore spaces. Bed porosity was the strongest influencer of nondimensional deposition rate; deposition increased with porosity. Deposition was inversely related to for the acrylic bed runs; no influence of was found for the porous bed runs. Increases in discharge resulted in resuspension of clay from acrylic beds; no resuspension was observed in the porous bed runs.},

Significant differences in QO2 were found between pre- and post-spawned fish. Salinity was found to elicit little or no response within the experimental range. Oxygen uptake has been related to body weight by seasonal partial regression coefficients ({\textasciitilde}0.7) the variations of which are similar to those found in other temperate estuarine species. The effects of temperature and salinity on the respiratory metabolism of Porichthys porosissimus reflect the euryplastic character of the species.}

  abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change, particularly through increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, is projected to impact 21st century precipitation distribution, altering fluvial processes such as riverine water discharge and sediment dynamics, worldwide. Changes in fluvial water and sediment discharges can have profound impacts on the functioning and connectivity of earth's natural systems. In this paper, we study the natural sensitivity of water discharge and suspended sediment fluxes in large global river systems to predicted climate change in the 21st century. A global-scale hydro-geomorphic model (WBMsed) was forced with precipitation and temperature projections generated by five General Circulation Models (GCMs), each driven by four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Anthropogenic drivers were excluded from the simulations in order to isolate the signal of 21st century climate change. The results, based on an ensemble of model outputs, revealed that global river discharge and sediment dynamics are highly sensitive to anthropogenic climate change in the 21st century. Increasing global warming will lead to more extreme changes and greater rates of changes (increasing or decreasing) in both variables. Despite substantial regional heterogeneity, a global net increase is projected for both natural river discharge and sediment flux toward the end of the 21st century under all climate change scenarios. These increases are larger with increasing levels of atmospheric warming. At the end of this century, projected climate changes under RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 scenarios, will lead to 2\%, 6\%, 7.5\% and 11\% increases respectively in mean global river discharge relative to the 1950{\textendash}2005 period, while mean global suspended sediment flux will show 11\%, 15\%, 14\% and 16.4\% increases under pristine conditions. In addition to magnitudes, inter-annual variability also increases with increasing warming. Changes in sediment flux closely follow the patterns predicted for discharge, and are mostly driven by climate warming-induced spatial and temporal variation in precipitation. However, the relationship between precipitation, discharge and sediment flux was found to be non-linear both in space and time, demonstrating the utility of explicit modeling of both hydrology and geomorphology.},

Of particular interest is the Athabasca River basin, a highly biologically productive basin that includes one of the largest boreal freshwater inland river deltas in the world and serves as habitat for many fish species. Earlier melt events, higher winter and spring flows and lower summer flows are expected as a consequence of climate change in this basin. Here, we model changes in river flow and water temperature under changing climate scenarios through the integration of a physically-based semi-distributed hydrological model and a 1D stream water temperature model forced by climate change scenarios. The modeled changes in streamflow and water temperature are used to predict changes in habitat suitability for the Athabasca Rainbow Trout (ART) (Oncorhynchus mykiss), a unique ecotype of trout considered as a `species at risk'. The results indicate that future flow decreases in most of the basin can lead to reduced flow velocities and water depths making current ART habitat suboptimal. Also, warming low-land habitats and increasing water temperatures will increase metabolic rates and stress fish forcing them to migrate upstream to cooler waters confining their habitat range.},

Results indicated a general increase in fire risk in both future scenarios over the whole study area. The increase in fire risk was mainly due to 3 components: (1) increase in the number of years with fire risk; (2) increase in the length of the season with fire risk; (3) increase of extreme events (e.g. total number of days with FWI {$>$}45 and episodes with FWI {$>$}45 for 7 consecutive days) during the fire season. As expected, A2 scenario showed a greater increase in risk than B2 scenario. These general increases in fire risk may have a very strong impact in areas where forest land cover is high (e.g. the Alps region in Italy, the Pyrenees in Spain and mountains of the Balkan region).},

In particular, an accurate computer prediction of the velocity field could benefit studies of channel morphology and pollution transport. In this paper, a meandering channel experiment from the U.K. Flood Channel Facility is simulated using computational fluid dynamics and the predicted velocities compared with the experimental data. Particular attention is paid to the reproduction of the secondary velocities and the helical motion of the water flowing within the main channel. Sensitivity tests of mesh design, discretization scheme, and roughness height are reported, together with the turbulence characteristics of the flow.},

As a consequence, morphodynamic models are increasingly developed, used and evaluated by non-experts, possibly leading to mistakes. This paper draws attention to five types of common mistakes. First, new morphodynamic codes are developed as extensions of existing hydrodynamic codes without including all essential physical processes. Second, model inputs are specified in a way that imposes morphodynamic patterns beforehand rather than letting them evolve freely. Third, detailed processes are parameterized inadequately for application to larger spatial and temporal scales. Fourth, physical and numerical phenomena are confused when interpreting model results. Fifth, the selection of modeling approaches is driven by the belief that complete data are a prerequisite for modeling and that the application of 2D and 3D models requires more data than the application of 1D models. Examples from fluvial morphodynamics are presented to illustrate these mistakes.},

  abstract = {The rate of migration, calculated by numerical models of river meandering, is commonly based on a method that relates the rate of migration to near-bank excess velocity multiplied by a dimensionless coefficient. Notwithstanding its simplicity, since the early 1980s this method has provided important insight into the long-term evolution of meander planforms through theoretical exercises. Its use in practice has not been as successful, because the complexity of the physical processes responsible for bank retreat, the heterogeneity in floodplain soils, and the presence of vegetation, make the calibration of the dimensionless coefficient rather challenging. This paper presents a new approach that calculates rates of meander migration using physicallybased streambank erosion formulations. The University of Illinois RVR Meander model, which simulates meandering-river flow and bed morphodynamics, is integrated with algorithms for streambank erosion of the US Department of Agriculture channel evolution computer model CONCEPTS. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to that of the more simple classic method through the application to several test cases for idealized and natural planform geometry. The advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed, focusing on simulated planform pattern, the impact of soil spatial heterogeneity, the relative importance of the different processes controlling bank erosion (hydraulic erosion, cantilever, and planar failure), the requirements for obtaining stable migration patterns (centerline filtering and interpolation of bank physical properties), and the capability of predicting the planform evolution of natural rivers over engineering time scales (i.e., 50 to 100 years). The applications show that the improved physically-based method of bank retreat is required to capture the complex long-term migration patterns of natural channels, which cannot be merely predicted from hydrodynamics only.},

A hydraulic plausibility check is performed based on stationary ADCP measurements to assess the performance of the model. Both the consideration of the wind and the plausibility check using an ADCP are hardly used in large reservoirs so far. The simulation results show a complex flow field with two large (re)circulation zones in the middle of the reservoir, whereby the temporal development of the simulated and measured velocities have comparable characteristics. Moreover, morphodynamic simulations are performed to compute the suspended sediment transport. The results show that the settling behavior of the sediments is mainly influenced by the inflow discharge and the operation level of the reservoir.},

  abstract = {Reservoir sedimentation reduces not only the available storage volume of  reservoirs, but may also create other serious problems, such as an increase of bed levels or accumulations of nutrients and contaminants, which affect the environment. An increase in bed levels at the head of the reservoir can reduce flood safety and increase the risk for the surrounding areas. Deposited sediments close to the dam may block hydraulic structures, such as the bottom outlets, or, in case they enter the intake, lead to possible abrasion of plant components (e.g. wear of turbines and pipes).Prior to reservoir construction, a pre-evaluation of the sediment yield from the catchment is usually performed by using soil erosion and sediment delivery models. However, the trapping efficiency is often only obtained by empirical approaches, such as Brune's or Churchill's curve, which are based on the capacity of the reservoir and the mean annual inflow. This is still common practice, although 3D hydro-morphodynamic models became powerful tools to numerically study sediment transport and reservoir sedimentation prior to the construction of reservoirs as well as during its operation.Within this study, a fully 3D hydro-morphodynamic numerical model, based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, is applied to a case study to simulate, on the one hand suspended sediment transport within a hydropower reservoir and on the other hand a reservoir flushing operation as potential management scenario, with the goal to remobilize already deposited sediments and to release these sediments from the reservoir. The modeled reservoir has a total storage capacity of around 14 million m{$^3$}, whereby the water level can fluctuate due to pumped-storage operation by 40.5 m (difference between the maximum operation level and the operational outlet). At the head is the natural inflow of two creeks into the reservoir and a lateral transition tunnel is located on the orographic right side, which collects several headwater streams from adjacent catchments.Simulations are performed for different operation modes of the reservoir. The results clearly show that through active reservoir management (variation of water levels as well as using the momentum of the discharge from the transition tunnel) the sediment motion in the reservoir can be affected to a certain extent. It is for instance possible to almost completely avoid reservoir sedimentation in front of the dam and the hydraulic structures (water intake and bottom outlets) during sediment-laden flows when simultaneously high discharges are provided from the laterally located transition tunnel. The conducted simulation results of reservoir flushing also show that the success of the flushing operation is strongly dependent on the water level. As expected, flushing with full drawdown of the water level is the most efficient method to release sediments.Through the detailed results of the 3D hydro-morphodynamic model, it is feasible to receive a deeper knowledge of the ongoing sediment transport processes within the studied reservoir. The gained knowledge can further be used to derive sustainable and efficient management strategies for the sediment management of the reservoir.}

The first step is to distinguish between precipitation in the form of rain (erosive) or snow (non-erosive). Additionally, snow-covered areas are detected at the end of each month using freely available satellite data (e.g. Sentinel-2). Based on the detected snow cover and the observed snow fall, the code calculates monthly snow pack dynamics and snowmelt. In the final step, the erosivity of precipitation (in this case: Rainfall erosivity model for complex terrains (Diodato, N., Bellocchi, G., 2007) and the erosivity due to snowmelt are calculated and combined into a total R-factor.

Large artificial reservoirs may effectively alleviate hydro-climatic extremes, but their storage capacities are threatened by sedimentation processes, which in turn are exacerbated by land use change. Envisioning strategies for sustainable reservoir management requires interdisciplinary model chains to emulate key processes driving sedimentation under global change scenarios. Therefore, we introduce a model chain for the long-term prediction of complex three-dimensional (3d) reservoir sedimentation considering concurrent catchment, hydro-climatic, and land-use conditions. Applied to a mountainous Mediterranean catchment, the model chain predicts increased sediment production and decreased discharge for high and medium emission pathways. Increased winter precipitation, accompanied by a transition from snowfall to rainfall, is projected to aggravate reduced summer precipitation, emphasizing a growing need for reservoirs. Additionally, higher winter precipitation proliferates sediment production and reservoir sedimentation. Land use change can outweigh the increased reservoir sedimentation originating from hydro-climatic change, which highlights the significance of localized actions to reduce sediment production. Finally, a 3d hydro-morphodynamic model provides insights into interactions between global change and reservoir sedimentation with spatially explicit information on future sedimentation patterns facilitating the implementation of management strategies.},

  abstract = {Modeling reservoir sedimentation is particularly challenging due to the simultaneous simulation of shallow shores, tributary deltas, and deep waters. The shallow upstream parts of reservoirs, where deltaic avulsion and erosion processes occur, compete with the validity of modeling assumptions used to simulate the deposition of fine sediments in deep waters. We investigate how complex numerical models can be calibrated to accurately predict reservoir sedimentation in the presence of competing model simplifications and identify the importance of calibration parameters for prioritization in measurement campaigns.~This study applies Bayesian calibration, a supervised learning technique using surrogate-assisted Bayesian inversion with a Gaussian Process Emulator to calibrate a two-dimensional (2d) hydro-morphodynamic model for simulating sedimentation processes in a reservoir in Albania. Four calibration parameters were fitted to obtain the statistically best possible simulation of bed level changes between 2016 and 2019 through two differently constraining data scenarios. One scenario included measurements from the entire upstream half of the reservoir. Another scenario only included measurements in the geospatially valid range of the numerical model. Model accuracy parameters, Bayesian model evidence, and the variability of the four calibration parameters indicate that Bayesian calibration only converges toward physically meaningful parameter combinations when the calibration nodes are in the valid range of the numerical model. The Bayesian approach also allowed for a comparison of multiple parameters and found that the dry bulk density of the deposited sediments is the most important factor for calibration.},

  abstract = {Fishes are appropriate indicators of trends in aquatic biodiversity because their enormous variety reflects a wide range of environmental conditions. Fish also have a major impact on the distribution and abundance of other organisms in waters they inhabit. Examination of trends in freshwater fish faunas from different parts of the world indicate that most faunas are in serious decline and in need of immediate protection. Species most likely to be threatened with immediate extinction are either specialized for life in large rivers or are endemic species with very small distributions. We conservatively estimate that 20 percent of the freshwater fish species of the world (ca. 1800 species) are already extinct or in serious decline. Evidence for serious declines in marine fishes is limited largely to estuarine fishes, reflecting their dependence on freshwater inflows, or to fishes in inland seas. The proximate causes of fish species' decline can be divided into five broad categories: (1) competition for water, (2) habitat alteration, (3) pollution, (4) introduction of exotic species, and (5) commercial exploitation. Although one or two principal causes of decline can be identified for each species, the decline is typically the result of multiple, cumulative, long-term effects. Ways to protect aquatic biodiversity include the implementation of landscape-level management strategies, the creation of aquatic preserves, and the restoration of degraded aquatic habitats. Without rapid adoption of such measures we are likely to experience an accelerated rate of extinctions in aquatic environments as human populations continue to expand.},

  abstract = {Calibration of building energy models is important to ensure accurate modeling of existing buildings. Typically this calibration is done manually by modeling experts, which can be both expensive and time consuming. Additionally, biases of the individual modelers will creep into the process. Many methods of automated calibration have been developed which reduce costs, time and biases, including optimization using genetic or swarming algorithms, machine learning methods, and Bayesian methods. Bayesian methods differ significantly from the other optimization and machine learning methods in that inputs are assumed to be uncertain and main goal is not to match the prediction to the measured data as closely as possible, but to reduce the uncertainty in the inputs in a manner consistent with the measured data. Bayesian methods are particularly useful when there are model inputs that have high sensitivity and high uncertainty and where there is limited measured data to use for calibration. In this paper, the basic concepts of Bayesian calibration are explained and a typical application and results are demonstrated.},

  abstract = {The present study examines variations in the reference shear stress for bed load transport ({$\tau$}r) using coupled measurements of flow and bed load transport in 45 gravel-bed streams and rivers. The study streams encompass a wide range in bank-full discharge (1{\textendash}2600 m3/s), average channel gradient (0.0003{\textendash}0.05), and median surface grain size (0.027{\textendash}0.21 m). A bed load transport relation was formed for each site by plotting individual values of the dimensionless transport rate W* versus the reach-average dimensionless shear stress {$\tau$}*. The reference dimensionless shear stress {$\tau$}*r was then estimated by selecting the value of {$\tau$}* corresponding to a reference transport rate of W* = 0.002. The results indicate that the discharge corresponding to {$\tau$}*r averages 67\% of the bank-full discharge, with the variation independent of reach-scale morphologic and sediment properties. However, values of {$\tau$}*r increase systematically with average channel gradient, ranging from 0.025{\textendash}0.035 at sites with slopes of 0.001{\textendash}0.006 to values greater than 0.10 at sites with slopes greater than 0.02. A corresponding relation for the bank-full dimensionless shear stress {$\tau$}*bf, formulated with data from 159 sites in North America and England, mirrors the relation between {$\tau$}*r and channel gradient, suggesting that the bank-full channel geometry of gravel- and cobble-bedded streams is adjusted to a relatively constant excess shear stress, {$\tau$}*bf - {$\tau$}*r, across a wide range of slopes.},

  abstract = {Current soil erosion and reservoir sedimentation modelling at the meso-scale is still faced with intrinsic problems with regard to open scaling questions, data demand, computational efficiency and deficient implementations of retention and re-mobilisation processes for the river and reservoir networks. To overcome some limitations of current modelling approaches, the semi-process-based, spatially semi-distributed modelling framework WASA-SED (Vers. 1) was developed for water and sediment transport in large dryland catchments. The WASA-SED model simulates the runoff and erosion processes at the hillslope scale, the transport and retention processes of suspended and bedload fluxes in the river reaches and the retention and remobilisation processes of sediments in reservoirs. The modelling tool enables the evaluation of management options both for sustainable land-use change scenarios to reduce erosion in the headwater catchments as well as adequate reservoir management options to lessen sedimentation in large reservoirs and reservoir networks. The model concept, its spatial discretisation scheme and the numerical components of the hillslope, river and reservoir processes are described and a model application for the meso-scale dryland catchment Isa{\textasciiacute}bena in the Spanish Pre-Pyrenees (445 km2) is presented to demonstrate the capabilities, strengths and limits of the model framework. The example application showed that the model was able to reproduce runoff and sediment transport dynamics of highly erodible headwater badlands, the transient storage of sediments in the dryland river system, the bed elevation changes of the 93 hm3 Barasona reservoir due to sedimentation as well as the life expectancy of the reservoir under different management options.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the use of optical and microwave remote sensing data for soil and terrain mapping with emphasis on applications at regional and coarser scales. Remote sensing is expected to offer possibilities for improving incomplete spatial and thematic coverage of current regional and global soil databases. Traditionally, remotely sensed imagery have been used to support segmentation of the landscape into rather homogeneous soil{\textendash}landscape units for which soil composition can be established by sampling. Soil properties have also been inferred from optical and microwave data using physically-based and empirical methods. Used as a secondary data source, remotely sensed imagery may support spatial interpolation of sparsely sampled soil property data. Soil properties that have been measured using remote or proximal sensing approaches include mineralogy, texture, soil iron, soil moisture, soil organic carbon, soil salinity and carbonate content. In sparsely vegetated areas, successful use of space borne, airborne, and in situ measurements using optical, passive and active microwave instruments has been reported. On the other hand, in densely vegetated areas, soil data acquisition typically relied on indirect retrievals using soil indicators, such as plant functional groups, productivity changes, and Ellenberg indicator values. Several forms of kriging, classification and regression tree analyses have been used jointly with remotely sensed data to predict soil properties at unvisited locations aiming at obtaining continuous area coverage. We expect that remotely sensed data from existing platforms and planned missions can provide an important data source supporting digital soil mapping. Yet, most studies so far have been performed on a local scale and only few on regional or smaller map scale. Although progress has been made, current methods and techniques still bear potential to further explore the full range of spectral, spatial and temporal properties of existing data sources. For example, space borne spectroscopy has been of limited use in retrieving soil data when compared to laboratory or field spectroscopy. To date, there is no coherent methodology established, where approaches of spatial segmentation, measurements of soil properties and interpolation using remotely sensed data are integrated in a holistic fashion to achieve complete area coverage. Such approaches will enhance the perspectives of using remotely sensed data for digital soil mapping.},

  abstract = {Distributed watershed models should pass through a careful calibration procedure before they are utilized as a decision making aid in the planning and management of water resources. Although manual approaches are still frequently used for calibration, they are tedious, time consuming, and require experienced personnel. This paper describes an automatic approach for calibrating daily streamflow and daily sediment concentration values estimated by the US Department of Agriculture's distributed watershed simulation model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The automatic calibration methodology applies a hierarchy of three techniques, namely screening, parameterization, and parameter sensitivity analysis, at the parameter identification stage of model calibration. The global parameter sensitivity analysis is conducted using a stepwise regression analysis on rank-transformed input{\textendash}output data pairs. Latin hypercube sampling is used to generate input data from the assigned distributions and ranges, and parameter estimation is performed using genetic algorithm. The Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation methodology is subsequently implemented to investigate uncertainty of model estimates, accounting for errors due to model structure, input data and model parameters. To demonstrate their effectiveness, the parameter identification, parameter estimation, model verification, and uncertainty analysis techniques are applied to a watershed located in southern Illinois.},

In this paper we propose an interactive method based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate fluids with free surfaces. The method is an extension of the SPH-based technique by Desbrun to animate highly deformable bodies. We gear the method towards fluid simulation by deriving the force density fields directly from the Navier-Stokes equation and by adding a term to model surface tension effects. In contrast to Eulerian grid-based approaches, the particle-based approach makes mass conservation equations and convection terms dispensable which reduces the complexity of the simulation. In addition, the particles can directly be used to render the surface of the fluid. We propose methods to track and visualize the free surface using point splatting and marching cubes-based surface reconstruction. Our animation method is fast enough to be used in interactive systems and to allow for user interaction with models consisting of up to 5000 particles.},

Flow velocities were measured by Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers near the intake/outlet structure to describe flow patterns induced by pumped-storage operation in an Alpine reservoir. Recorded data allowed reproducing 1D and 2D velocity profiles along the water column. The comparison between the main frequencies of the velocity signal and the discharge series from the plant reveals correlation between recorded flow patterns and pumped-storage operation. Numerical modeling enhanced the understanding of flow patterns developing near the intake/outlet structure. Both results reveal that water withdrawal by pumping only marginally affects flow patterns in front of the intake, whereas water injected during turbine mode leads to backflow areas and large-scale recirculation cells. Numerical modeling further revealed that steady flow patterns are developing only after some 2.5 h of continuous turbine operation.},

Therefore, a need exists to tackle equifinality and quantify the uncertainty bands of a model. In this paper we use the concepts of equifinality, identifiability and uncertainty to propose a simple method aimed at constraining the equifinal parameters and reducing the uncertainty bands of model outputs, and obtaining physically possible and reasonable models. Additionally, the uncertainty of equifinal solutions is quantified to estimate the amount by which output uncertainty can be reduced by knowing how to discard most of the equifinal solutions of a model. As a study case, a conceptual model of the Chill{\'a}n basin in Chile is carried out. From the study it is concluded that using identifiability analysis makes it possible to constrain equifinal solutions with reduced uncertainty and realistic models, resulting in a framework that can be recommended to practitioners, especially due to the simplicity of the method.},

The potential significance of these interactions, which take place at a microscale level of millimetres to metres, for the large-scale geomorphology of the seabed has rarely been appreciated. In the context of this review, large-scale is defined as greater than 50 in to hundreds of kilometres. The present review addresses this link, drawing examples from a wide range of marine environments, including estuaries, the intertidal zone, continental shelves and slopes, and the deep sea. It firstly considers sediment stabilisation, slope failure, sediment mixing, biodeposition, sediment compaction, and hydrodynamic effects. This is followed by a consideration of two extremes of the ecological pyramid-the effects of marine meiofauna and marine vertebrates. The final section draws attention to the central role of faunal mucus and extracellular polymeric material (ECPM) in many of the microscale interactions that we describe. The implications of these microscale biological processes and features are discussed in terms of their influence on and control of the large-scale geomorphology of the seabed.

  abstract = {Shuffled Complex Evolution{\textemdash}University of Arizona (SCE-UA) has been used extensively and proved to be a robust and efficient global optimization method for the calibration of conceptual models. In this paper, two enhancements to the SCEUA algorithm are proposed, one to improve its exploration and another to improve its exploitation of the search space. A strategically located initial population is used to improve the exploration capability and a modification to the downhill simplex search method enhances its exploitation capability. This enhanced version of SCE-UA is tested, first on a suite of test functions and then on a conceptual rainfall-runoff model using synthetically generated runoff values. It is observed that the strategically located initial population drastically reduces the number of failures and the modified simplex search also leads to a significant reduction in the number of function evaluations to reach the global optimum, when compared with the original SCE-UA. Thus, the two enhancements significantly improve the robustness and efficiency of the SCE-UA model calibrating algorithm. Copyright  2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {For the modelling of river dynamics secondary flow, the helical motion which occurs perpendicular to the primary flow direction, is essential. Recently, modelling on unstructured grids is rapidly becoming more accessible for river engineers. Unstructured modelling allows greater flexibility in setting up a model, where complex boundaries can be more accurately captured than when using a structured curvilinear grid. In previous numerical studies the parameterization of the secondary flow is generally computed on structured grids. In the presence of non-uniformity of unstructured grids, the calculation of the secondary flow undergoes into spatial inaccuracies because of difficulties in the reconstruction of the velocity gradients with sufficient accuracy. In this study, a new method based on least-square reconstruction technique is used to compute the velocity gradients on uniform and non-uniform triangular grids. This method leads to sufficiently high spatial accuracy which allows the computation of the secondary flow intensity with sufficient accuracy. This technique is validated with theoretical and experimental studies conducted by Kalkwijk \& Booij (1986). Good agreement is found between the computed secondary flow intensity and the past theoretical and experimental studies. Moreover, in order to study the effect of the spiral flow on the bed morphology, we simulated morphology in a curved bend and found that phenomenologically the pattern from previous Delft3D implementation for structured grids is well reproduced. Further validation with experiments is currently being performed.},

The model can be used for investigating both bed-deformation and bankline shifting in 2D plan form. The basic equations are used in a moving boundary fitted-coordinate system, and a new formulation of nonequilibrium sediment transport is introduced to reproduce the channel processes. The model was applied to examine the morphological behavior of experimental channels. Temporal changes in the plan form in a meandering channel can be classified into two patterns: meander developing and meander straightening. Comparison of the observed and calculated results indicates that the model is applicable to both channel changes under various hydraulic conditions. On the basis of the numerical findings, the paper clarifies the influence of hydraulic variables on the location of bank erosion and bed scouring. The model also was used to investigate the effect of alternate bars on bank erosion and to investigate the development of channel meandering from an initially straight channel.},

  abstract = {Spawning substrate quality is a major factor influencing the early ontogeny of European nase (Chondrostoma nasus), a target species of conservation. Analogous to findings from salmonids, restoration of spawning grounds was hypothesized to enhance spawning, development and thus recruitment success of nase, by improving the substrate quality, and subsequently spawning site use, egg infiltration and protection of larvae in the interstitial zones before emergence. These assumptions were tested using a comparative approach by cleaning 50\% of the area of each spawning ground in two Bavarian rivers. Substrate cleaning resulted in an immediate reduction of 70\% fine sediment content with improvements still detectable 2 months later. Spawning nase used the restored areas of spawning grounds preferentially, which was evident in the number of spawning fish and the significantly higher number of eggs laid. Infiltration of eggs into the interstitial zone was distinctly more successful in the opened interstices of the cleaned spawning substrate, where they were found down to a depth of 20 cm. The same was true for larvae, which could be found down to 30 cm and up to 13 days after hatching. Moreover, higher peaks in the drift density of emerging larvae from the restored spawning substrate were detected (2.5 compared with 1.7 larvae m-3 discharge for the River Mangfall and 0.3 compared with 0.03 larvae m-3 for the River Sims). These results clearly indicate that gravel cleaning is a successful short-term restoration tool for nase spawning grounds. It is a quick, cheap and effective method for the conservation management of nase, which may also be applicable to other riverine species with a similiar ecology and incubation time, such as Barbus barbus, Squalius cephalus, Leuciscus leuciscus and Phoxinus phoxinus. This especially holds true if streams lack internal dynamics and suffer from high loads of fine sediment and colmation.},

However, in spite of the great advances in computer technology, such direct simulation resolving the motions of all scales is possible only for strongly idealized situations at low Reynolds numbers, for which the spectrum of scales is not so wide. At the high Reynolds numbers usually encountered in practice, the size of the smallest turbulence eddies is only some 10{\textendash}4 to 10{\textendash}3 of the water depth. With presently available supercomputers, direct simulations of closed-channel flow for a Reynolds number of 3300 have been conducted, but they required 4 million grid points and 250 hours of supercomputer time (Kim et al. 1987). The results obtained are significant because they reveal all of the structural behavior of turbulence that has been observed experimentally.},

We have developed a small glass separator, without a valve, taking a hint from an Uterm{\"o}hl chamber.

With this simple device, we recovered 94{\textendash}98\% of {$<$}1,000 {\textmu}m microplastics (polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, and polystyrene). Overall, the device is efficient for various sizes, polymer types, and sediment types.

The maximum value of the real part of the eigenvalue is used as an objective cost function. The shape derivative of the cost function is defined as the Fr{\'e}chet derivative of the cost function with respect to arbitrary variation of the design variable, which denotes the domain variation, and is evaluated using the Lagrange multiplier method. To obtain a numerical solution, we use an iterative algorithm based on the H 1 gradient method using the finite element method. To confirm the validity of the solution, a numerical example for two-dimensional Poiseuille flow with a sudden expansion is presented. Results reveal that a critical Reynolds number increases by the iteration of reshaping.},

  abstract = {The lack of any protection against eutrophication is progressively compromising the water quality of Sicilian reservoirs. These water bodies provide the population with an adequate supply of drinking water and support most of the irrigation requirements of local agriculture. Moreover, they respond to the Mediterranean climate, with sequential, seasonally predictable events of flooding and drying and whose intensity varies markedly between years. As a consequence of summer drought and the policy to meet water demand throughout the season, the reservoirs experience massive dewatering, resulting in a reduction in the spring storage volume of 90\%. Thus, they start the hydrological season as water bodies deep enough to form stable stratification but a thermocline has generally disappeared by the middle of summer and, as a consequence of the intense drawdown, they are transformed into shallow water bodies. This dual behaviour, driven by a progressive and conspicuous depth decrease, interferes with nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics, enhancing eutrophication phenomena and contributing to the selection of planktic cyanobacteria that are potentially dangerous to human health.},

  abstract = {Research on identifying cost-effective managed ecosystems that can substantially remove atmospheric carbon-dioxide (CO2) while providing essential societal benefits has gained momentum since the Kyoto Protocol of 1997. Carbon farming allows farmers and investors to generate tradable carbon offsets from farmlands and forestry projects through carbon trading. Carbon trading is pertinent to climate negotiations by decelerating the climate change phenomenon. Thus, the objective of this article is to describe the potential of woody bamboos in biomass carbon storage and as an option for carbon farming and carbon trading. Bamboo is an important agroforestry and forest plant managed and used by the rural communities in several countries of the Asia-Pacific region for generating diverse economic and socio-environmental needs. Mean carbon storage and sequestration rate in woody bamboos range from 30{\textendash}121~Mg~ha-1 and 6{\textendash}13~Mg~ha-1 ~yr-1, respectively. Bamboo has vigorous growth, with completion of the growth cycle between 120 and 150 days. Because of its rapid biomass accumulation and effective fixation of CO2, it has a high carbon sequestration capacity. Over and above the high biomass carbon storage, bamboo also has a high net primary productivity (12{\textendash}26~Mg~ha-1 ~yr-1) even with regular selective harvesting, thus making it a standing carbon stock and a living ecosystem that continues to grow. Despite its high potential in carbon storage and sequestration and its important role in livelihood of millions of rural poor's worldwide, prospects of bamboo ecosystems in CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) and REDD (Reduced Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) schemes remain to be explored. Thus, there is an urgent need to recognize ecosystem services that woody bamboo provides for well-being of rural communities and nature conservancy. Present synthesis suggests that bamboo offers tremendous opportunity for carbon farming and carbon trading.},

Erosion models used in applications for conservation planning fall into two basic categories: empirical and process-based. The prime example of an empirically based model is the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), which was developed in the United States. The USLE was upgraded to the Revised USLE (RUSLE) - a hybrid model - during the 1990s. In areas where data are few, or computations need to be kept simple, the USLE has distinct advantages over RUSLE and Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP).},

  abstract = {Numerical modeling represents a state-of-the-art technique to simulate hydro-morphodynamic processes in river ecosystems. Numerical models are often validated based on observed topographic change in the form of pixel information on net erosion or deposition over a simulation period. When model validation is performed by a pixel-by-pixel comparison of exactly superimposed simulated and observed pixels, zero or negative correlation coefficients are often calculated, suggesting poor model performance. Thus, a pixel-by-pixel approach penalizes quantitative simulation errors, even if a model conceptually works well. To distinguish between reasonably well-performing and non-representative models, this study introduces and tests fuzzy map comparison methods. First, we use a fuzzy numerical map comparison to compensate for spatial offset errors in correlation analyses. Second, we add a level of fuzziness with a fuzzy kappa map comparison to additionally address quantitative inaccuracy in modeled topographic change by categorizing data. Sample datasets from a physical lab model and datasets from a 6.9 km long gravel{\textendash}cobble bed river reach enable the verification of the relevance of fuzzy map comparison methods. The results indicate that a fuzzy numerical map comparison is a viable technique to compensate for model errors stemming from spatial offset. In addition, fuzzy kappa map comparisons are suitable for objectively expressing subjectively perceived correlation between two maps, provided that a small number of categories is used. The methods tested and the resulting spatially explicit comparison maps represent a significant opportunity to improve the evaluation and potential calibration of numerical models of river ecosystems in the future.},

However, clogging is driven by multiple, interacting physical and bio-geochemical parameters, which do not allow for a conclusive assessment of hyporheic connectivity with single-parameter approaches. In addition, existing qualitative assessments lack transparency and repeatability. This study introduces a Multi-Parameter Approach to quantify Clogging and vertical hyporheic connectivity (MultiPAC), which builds on standardized measurements of physical (grain size characteristics, porosity, hydraulic conductivity) and bio-geochemical (interstitial dissolved oxygen) parameters. We apply MultiPAC at three gravel-bed rivers and show how the set of parameters provides a representative appreciation of physical riverbed clogging, thus quantifying vertical hyporheic connectivity. However, more parameters are required to fully characterize biological clogging. In addition, MultiPAC locates clogged layers in the hyporheic zone through multi-parameter vertical profiles over the riverbed depth. The discussion outlines the relevance of MultiPAC to guide field surveys.},

This study introduces a relational database framed in an application called River Analyst for creating and managing river data with open-source standards (Python3 and Django). We conceptualize data models of river environments, which describe sediment characteristics and hydraulics related to hyporheic exchange. River Analyst enabled us to derive novel insights for restoring rivers affected by so-called riverbed clogging, notably, fine sediment infiltration in the hyporheic zone. The database analysis reveals that clogging is not a dominant control process when the fraction of fine sediment exceeds 50\%{\textendash}55\%.

The total boundary shear stress field obtained from our computations includes both skin friction and the form drag associated with pressure forces on bars and bedforms. A simple method for removing the form drag component is described, thereby permitting computation of the bottom stress responsible for sediment transport. Results of our calculations are compared to measurements obtained in Muddy Creek, a sand-bedded meandering stream in Wyoming possessing the characteristics typical of natural channels. Model predictions of velocity, boundary shear stress, and surface elevation are shown to be in excellent agreement with the measurements, primarily due to the careful treatment of convective accelerations in the governing equations.},

Three non-Newtonian models, used in the literature for simulating the rheological behaviour of blood, are employed, namely the Casson, Power-Law, and Quemada models. The computations reveal that similar to Newtonian flow through a suddenly expanded channel, an instability also occurs in non-Newtonian flows. The instability is manifested by a symmetry breaking of the flow separation. The onset of the instability depends on the specific parameters involved in each model's constitutive equation. The investigation encompasses a parametric study for each model, specifically the critical values at which transition from stable to unstable flow occurs. Due to the fact that for each of the Casson and Quemada models, two characteristic flow parameters exist, the relation between the critical values for each of these parameters is also examined.},

The subsequent effects are investigated by means of different flow parameters namely the generalised Reynolds (Re) number, the Re number defined in accordance with the inlet wall viscosity and the Re number resulting from the nondimensionalisation of the shear{\textendash}stress versus shear{\textendash}rate expression. Results reveal that for both the Power{\textendash}Law and Casson model cases studied, the critical generalised Re number of transition from symmetry to asymmetry and subsequently the inverse dimensionless wall shear stress are linearly related to the dimensionless shear rate at the wall. Similar relation with the latter is exhibited by the factors defined by the product of the Re number defined in accordance with the inlet wall viscosity and either the dimensionless partial derivative of pressure or u-velocity with respect to x along the channel centreline.},

Although this assessment tool has been used worldwide for decades, the history of the HSC curve is relatively unknown because the foundational information is predominantly contained in obscure and often unpublished reports. We review the history of the HSC concept in applied aquatic ecology to clarify its scientific pedigree, ensure its proper use, and build a foundation for future research. We begin the review with the formative decades of the 1950's through the 1970's, when consumptive-based western USA water law conflicted with conservation traditions and natural resource management objectives, although water allocation issues date back at least to the 19th century. By analysing the history of the HSC concept, we aim to establish the biological, hydrologic, and geomorphological conditions that must be met for the HSC concept to be successfully employed. In spite of its documented assumptions and limitations, the HSC concept will likely continue to be a useful tool to help address water resources allocation issues in defined hydrologic and geomorphic settings. We conclude that HSC-based methodologies should be considered as one of several environmental flow approaches involved in sustainable water resources management.},

To aid in the assessment of this impact a series of flume experiments, designed to mimic seabed conditions below a fish farm, was conducted with the aim of examining the effects of fish pellets on the stability of fine sediments. Artificial beds, with varying quantities of fish pellets incorporated both within the sediment matrix and lying on the sediment surface, were allowed to consolidate for different periods of time ranging from I to 10 days, and then subjected to erosion experiments. In flume experiments containing fish pellets, a bacterial biofilm developed at the sediment-water interface after a few days. In the control experiments (no fish pellets), a diatom biofilm caused extensive stabilisation of the surface sediment. The erosion experiments showed that the addition of fish pellets reduced the surface erosion threshold by more than 50\%. The stability decrease was more pronounced in the experiments with greater amounts of pellets. Evidence of drag reduction due to high suspended sediment concentration was also observed. This phenomenon is discussed and a correction formula is proposed for the effective shear stress experienced by the bed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Using mid-water and bottom trawls we found that these fish inhabit the bottom of the lake (5{\textdegree} C) during the day but migrate 30{\textendash}40 m into the water column at night where they reside in the metalimnion or epilimnion at temperatures near 13{\textendash}16{\textdegree}C. Larger fish do not migrate into the water column. Stomach analyses demonstrated that the young-of-the-year fish do not migrate into the water column to feed: from July to October their diet is 70{\textendash}93\% benthic ostracods and copepods, and pelagic prey are rarely consumed. Furthermore, gut fullness of the sculpin increases through the daylight period and decreases through the night, reaching minimum levels just before the dawn descent. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the diel migration would increase digestion rate from 3\%/h at profundal temperatures, to 22\%/h in the warmer surface water, thus allowing the fish to empty their guts overnight and permit feeding the following day. Additionally, sculpin held in a temperature and feeding regime that mimicked that experienced by migrating fish grew 300\% faster than those reared at 5{\textdegree} C. Given the overwhelming importance of fast growth for juvenile fishes, a post-feeding thermotaxs that increases digestion may be a common phenomenon increasing growth, and affecting the distribution and bioenergetic relationships of fish.},

First, the SCE algorithm is merged with the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to form the SCE-DE algorithm. Then, a complex mathematical function is used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance and validate the SCE-DE algorithm and the outcomes are compared with the original SCE algorithm to show the superiority of the proposed SCE-DE algorithm. In addition, the two-reservoir system of Dez-Gotvand is considered as a real optimization problem to evaluate the performance of the SCE-DE algorithm. It is revealed that optimization by SCE-DE is much better than SCE. In conclusion, the results show that the proposed SCE-DE algorithm is a reasonable alternative to optimizing resource systems and can be used to solve complex issues of water resources.},

Near the wall a special approach is applied in order to overcome the weakness of the standard k{\textendash}{$\epsilon$} model in the viscous sub-layer. A special shape function is used in the near wall elements to accurately describe the strong variations of the mean flow variables in the viscosity-affected near wall region. At the free surface, a moving boundary condition combined with the surface tracking procedure is applied to determine the position of the free surface. Eventually, in order to solve a large nonlinear equation system, which is obtained from the discretization of the continuity and momentum equations, a segregated approach is applied.

Using river discharge, rainfall and river stage data from the Haraz River, Iran, the results revealed: (a) the RS model provided a superior predictive accuracy (NSE = 0.83) to SVM-RBF (NSE = 0.80), SVM-NPK (NSE = 0.78) and RF (NSE = 0.68), corresponding to very good, good, satisfactory and unsatisfactory accuracies in load prediction; (b) the RBF kernel outperformed the NPK kernel; (c) the predictive capability was most sensitive to gamma and epsilon in SVM models, maximum depth of a tree and the number of features in RF models, classifier type, number of trees and subspace size in RS models; and (d) suspended sediment loads were most closely correlated with river discharge (PCC = 0.76). Overall, the results show that RS models have great potential in data poor watersheds, such as that studied here, to produce strong predictions of suspended load based on monthly records of river discharge, rainfall depth and river stage alone.},

Fostering the sustainability of water uses e.g., hydropower systems thus implies searching for innovative operational policies able to generate Dynamic Environmental Flows (DEF) that mimic natural flow variability. The objective of this study is to propose a Direct Policy Search (DPS) framework based on defining dynamic flow release rules to improve the global efficiency of storage systems. The water allocation policies proposed for dammed systems are an extension of previously developed flow redistribution rules for small hydropower plants by Razurel et{\dbend}al. (2016).The mathematical form of the Fermi-Dirac statistical distribution applied to lake equations for the stored water in the dam is used to formulate non-proportional redistribution rules that partition the flow for energy production and environmental use. While energy production is computed from technical data, riverine ecological benefits associated with DEF are computed by integrating the Weighted Usable Area (WUA) for fishes with Richter's hydrological indicators. Then, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are applied to build ecological versus economic efficiency plot and locate its (Pareto) frontier. This study benchmarks two MOEAs (NSGA II and Borg MOEA) and compares their efficiency in terms of the quality of Pareto's frontier and computational cost. A detailed analysis of dam characteristics is performed to examine their impact on the global system efficiency and choice of the best redistribution rule. Finally, it is found that non-proportional flow releases can statistically improve the global efficiency, specifically the ecological one, of the hydropower system when compared to constant minimal flows.},

  abstract = {Substantial uncertainties in bedload transport predictions in steep streams have encouraged intensive efforts towards the development of surrogate monitoring technologies. One such system, the Swiss plate geophone (SPG), has been deployed and calibrated in numerous steep channels, mainly in the Alps. Calibration relationships linking the signal recorded by the SPG system to the intensity and characteristics of transported bedload can vary substantially between different monitoring stations, likely due to site-specific factors such as flow velocity and bed roughness. Furthermore, recent flume experiments on the SPG system have shown that site-specific calibration relationships can be biased by elastic waves resulting from impacts occurring outside the plate boundaries. Motivated by these findings, we present a hybrid calibration procedure derived from flume experiments and an extensive dataset of 308 direct field measurements at four different SPG monitoring stations. Our main goal is to investigate the feasibility of a general, site-independent calibration procedure for inferring fractional bedload transport from the SPG signal. First, we use flume experiments to show that sediment size classes can be distinguished more accurately using a combination of vibrational frequency and amplitude information than by using amplitude information alone. Second, we apply this amplitude{\textendash}frequency method to field measurements to derive general calibration coefficients for 10 different grain-size fractions. The amplitude{\textendash}frequency method results in more homogeneous signal responses across all sites and significantly improves the accuracy of fractional sediment flux and grain-size estimates. We attribute the remaining site-to-site discrepancies to large differences in flow velocity and discuss further factors that may influence the accuracy of these bedload estimates.},

Surface water temperatures in such pools were commonly 3{\textendash}9{\textdegree}C higher than those at the bottom. Cold water entered pools from tributaries, intergravel flow through river bars, and streamside subsurface sources. In Redwood and Rancheria Creeks, cold water was protected where gravel bars encroached into pools that were scoured along bedrock banks, creating isolated backwaters. Sixty-five percent of the juvenile steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss found in the Rancheria Creek study reaches moved into adjacent stratified pools during periods of high ambient stream temperatures (23{\textendash}28{\textdegree}C). Fish showed a decline in forage behavior and increased agonistic activity just before movement into stratified pools. In the Middle Fork Eel River, pools deeper than 3 m stratified when surface flow decreased to less than 1 m3/s. Summer-run steelhead adults were found in deep stratified pools on the Middle Fork Eel River throughout summer when midday ambient stream temperatures ranged from 26 to 29{\textdegree}C and coldwater pockets averaged 3.5{\textdegree}C cooler. Thermally stratified pools provided refuge habitat for significant numbers of young-of-the-year, yearling, and adult steelhead in marginal river habitats where stream temperatures reach upper incipient lethal levels.},

These relationships explicitly include the form-induced stresses and form drag as components of the total stress. Using this approach, we define three types of rough-bed flows: (1) Flow with high relative submergence; (2) flow with small relative submergence; and (3) flow over a partially inundated rough bed. The relationships for the double-averaged velocity distribution and hydraulic resistance for all three flow types are derived and compared with measurements where possible. The double-averaged turbulent and form-induced intensities and stresses for the case of regular spherical-segment-type roughness show the dominant role of the double-averaged turbulence stresses and form drag in momentum transfer in the near-bed region.},

The assessment of these processes is also useful for water resource management and long-term sustainability of any hydrological project. In this study, an attempt is made to quantify the effects of climate change on streamflow and sediment concentration in the Purna river basin, India. Three Regional Circulation Models (RCMs) with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 for the four future periods of P1 (2009{\textendash}2031), P2 (2032{\textendash}2053), P3 (2054{\textendash}2075) and P4 (2076{\textendash}2099) are considered. Differences in scenarios are compared with the base period 1980{\textendash}2005. The SWAT is used on monthly basis for the period 1980 to 2005 with calibration period 1980 to 1994 and validation period 1995 to 2005. The projected precipitation and temperature show a significant increasing trend compared to the baseline condition for both RCPs. Similarly, the average monthly streamflow is projected to increase by 24.47 to 115.94m3/s whereas average monthly sediment concentration by 32.58 to 162.96mg/l under RCP 4.5 and 8.5. In particular, streamflow and sediment are expected to increase significantly from June to September at the outlet of the basin. The study results give insight into future hydrological scenarios which will be useful for policy makers to implement effective water resource strategies.},

  abstract = {Despite substantial research on various aspects of velocity distributions in curved meander rivers, no systematic effort has yet been made to establish the relationship between the dominant meander wavelength, discharge and the velocity distributions. In this research the secondary current theory is used in investigating the wavelength of a meander when it just emerges in a river channel. Rate of meander growth and downstream migration velocity is also investigated. To achieve this, a small-perturbation stability analysis is developed for investigation of the role of the secondary current accompanying channel curvature in the initiation and early development of meanders in open channels. Equations of the transverse velocity profile are analyzed. Since the magnitude of the vertical velocity is negligible compared to the transverse velocity in secondary currents, this study concentrates on the transverse velocity which is the radial component of the secondary current. This formulation leads to a linear differential equation which is solved for its orthogonal components which give the rates of meander growth and downstream migration. It is found that the amplitude of the meanders tends to increase and that the meanders migrate downstream.},

  abstract = {In this research, the secondary current theory is used in investigating the role of phase shift angle between the secondary current and the channel axis displacement in stability analysis of a river channel. To achieve this, a small-perturbation stability analysis is developed for investigation of the role of the secondary current accompanying channel curvature in the initiation and early development of meanders in open channels. The secondary currents are generating in planes perpendicular to the primary direction of motion. The secondary currents form a helical motion in which the water in the upper part of the river is driven outward, whereas the water near the bottom is driven inward in a bend. Force-momentum equations for longitudinal and transverse direction in open channel bends were utilized. Assuming that the transverse force contributed by the bed is negligible, the pressure force associated with the transverse surface inclination is balanced by the centripetal force. Existing equations of the transverse velocity profile were analyzed. Since the magnitude of the vertical velocity is negligible compared to the transverse velocity in secondary currents, this study concentrates on the transverse velocity which is the radial component of the secondary current. This formulation leads to a linear differential equation which is solved for its orthogonal components which give the rates of meander growth and downstream migration. It is shown that instability increases with decrease in phase shift angle. Transition from straight to meandering and then from meandering to braiding occurs when phase shift angle is reduced.},

Hence, sitespecific investigations are required to develop water management strategies as well as modelling approaches to predict the dynamic behavior of cohesive material. The Institute for Modelling Hydraulic and Environmental Systems (IWS, University of Stuttgart) has a long record in developing measuring strategies and techniques to deal with the complex interactions between biological and sedimentary characteristics regarding the erosion behavior of cohesive material. Specifically, the detection of critical shear stresses for incipient motion of cohesive particles has been realized for both one laboratory device (SETEG) and an in situ device. This paper presents results from two measuring campaigns in different rivers analyzing correlations between sedimentary and biological attributes and indicating the chances and drawbacks of both measuring techniques.},

In many applications, especially including remote sensing, it is not feasible to fully design and train a new ConvNet, as this usually requires a considerable amount of labeled data and demands high computational costs. Therefore, it is important to understand how to better use existing ConvNets. We perform experiments with six popular ConvNets using three remote sensing datasets. We also compare ConvNets in each strategy with existing descriptors and with state-of-the-art baselines. Results point that fine tuning tends to be the best performing strategy. In fact, using the features from the fine-tuned ConvNet with linear SVM obtains the best results. We also achieved state-of-the-art results for the three datasets used.},

  abstract = {Climate change in the Mediterranean is expected to lead to lower total rainfall and soil moisture, together with higher storm intensities; different vegetation types are expected to react positively or negatively to these and other changes. Climate change could therefore have positive or negative impacts on runoff and soil erosion during storms, and previous research has indicated that the impacts could be different at the field, hillslope and catchment scales. This problem was assessed for two Mediterranean watersheds by a combined application of the PROMES regional climate model, the SWAT continuous hydrological and vegetation model, and the MEFIDIS storm runoff and erosion model. PROMES results were used to estimate changes to storm rainfall intensity, while SWAT was applied with the PROMES results to estimate changes to soil moisture and saturation deficit, as well as vegetation cover. The results from both models were used to generate scenarios of changes to storm intensity (increasing), saturation deficit (increasing) and vegetation cover (increasing according to vegetation type). These scenarios were used as input for the MEFIDIS model to study the impacts of these changes on runoff and soil erosion across spatial scales for a set of storms. The simulation results indicate that (i) the increase in saturation deficit and vegetation cover is sufficient, in many cases, to decrease or counterbalance the impacts of increased storm intensity on soil erosion at all spatial scales; (ii) catchment sediment yield is noticeably more sensitive to the climate change scenarios than within-watershed soil erosion, mostly due to the impacts of changes to saturation deficit and vegetation cover on connectivity; (iii) within the watershed, impacts on soil erosion vary with landcover type, with croplands suffering the most negative impacts.},

  abstract = {Despite being one of the most profitable crops for the southeastern USA, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is considered to create a greater soil erosion hazard than other annual crops such as corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). Reduced tillage systems and cover cropping can reduce soil erosion and leaching of nutrients into ground water. The objectives of this study, which was conducted in north Alabama from 1996 to 1998, were to assess the impact of no-till and mulch-till systems with a winter rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop and poultry litter on soil erosion estimates in cotton plots using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). Soil erosion estimates in conventional till plots with or without a winter rye cover crop and ammonium nitrate fertilizer were double the 11tha-1yr-1 tolerance level for the Decatur series soils. However, using poultry litter as the N source (100kgNha-1) gave soil erosion estimates about 50\% below the tolerance level under conventional till. Doubling the N rate through poultry litter to 200kgNha-1 under no-till system gave the lowest soil erosion estimate level. No-till and mulch-till gave erosion estimates which were about 50\% of the tolerance level with or without cover cropping or N fertilization. This study shows that no-till and mulch-till systems with cover cropping and poultry litter can reduce soil erosion in addition to increasing cotton growth and lint yields, and thus improve sustainability of cotton soils in the southeastern USA.},

  abstract = {Verification and validation (V\&V) are the primary means to assess accuracy and reliability in computational simulations. This paper presents an extensive review of the literature in V\&V in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), discusses methods and procedures for assessing V\&V, and develops a number of extensions to existing ideas. The review of the development of V\&V terminology and methodology points out the contributions from members of the operations research, statistics, and CFD communities. Fundamental issues in V\&V are addressed, such as code verification versus solution verification, model validation versus solution validation, the distinction between error and uncertainty, conceptual sources of error and uncertainty, and the relationship between validation and prediction. The fundamental strategy of verification is the identification and quantification of errors in the computational model and its solution. In verification activities, the accuracy of a computational solution is primarily measured relative to two types of highly accurate solutions: analytical solutions and highly accurate numerical solutions. Methods for determining the accuracy of numerical solutions are presented and the importance of software testing during verification activities is emphasized. The fundamental strategy of validation is to assess how accurately the computational results compare with the experimental data, with quantified error and uncertainty estimates for both. This strategy employs a hierarchical methodology that segregates and simplifies the physical and coupling phenomena involved in the complex engineering system of interest. A hypersonic cruise missile is used as an example of how this hierarchical structure is formulated. The discussion of validation assessment also encompasses a number of other important topics. A set of guidelines is proposed for designing and conducting validation experiments, supported by an explanation of how validation experiments are different from traditional experiments and testing. A description is given of a relatively new procedure for estimating experimental uncertainty that has proven more effective at estimating random and correlated bias errors in wind-tunnel experiments than traditional methods. Consistent with the authors' contention that nondeterministic simulations are needed in many validation comparisons, a three-step statistical approach is offered for incorporating experimental uncertainties into the computational analysis. The discussion of validation assessment ends with the topic of validation metrics, where two sample problems are used to demonstrate how such metrics should be constructed. In the spirit of advancing the state of the art in V\&V, the paper concludes with recommendations of topics for future research and with suggestions for needed changes in the implementation of V\&V in production and commercial software. r 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {Verification and validation (V\&V) are the primary means to assess the accuracy and reliability of computational simulations. V\&V methods and procedures have fundamentally improved the credibility of simulations in several high-consequence fields, such as nuclear reactor safety, underground nuclear waste storage, and nuclear weapon safety. Although the terminology is not uniform across engineering disciplines, code verification deals with assessing the reliability of the software coding, and solution verification deals with assessing the numerical accuracy of the solution to a computational model. Validation addresses the physics modeling accuracy of a computational simulation by comparing the computational results with experimental data. Code verification benchmarks and validation benchmarks have been constructed for a number of years in every field of computational simulation. However, no comprehensive guidelines have been proposed for the construction and use of V\&V benchmarks. For example, the field of nuclear reactor safety has not focused on code verification benchmarks, but it has placed great emphasis on developing validation benchmarks. Many of these validation benchmarks are closely related to the operations of actual reactors at near-safety-critical conditions, as opposed to being more fundamental-physics benchmarks. This paper presents recommendations for the effective design and use of code verification benchmarks based on manufactured solutions, classical analytical solutions, and highly accurate numerical solutions. In addition, this paper presents recommendations for the design and use of validation benchmarks, highlighting the careful design of building-block experiments, the estimation of experimental measurement uncertainty for both inputs and outputs to the code, validation metrics, and the role of model calibration in validation. It is argued that the understanding of predictive capability of a computational model is built on the level of achievement in V\&V activities, how closely related the V\&V benchmarks are to the actual application of interest, and the quantification of uncertainties related to the application of interest.},

Alterations to feedbacks between important eco-physical structuring processes driven by climate change may modulate river morphology, floodplain characteristics, and their biological communities. Current understanding is reviewed and synthesised to explore the potential responses, mechanisms, and ramifications of climatic shifts for the European riverscape. Fundamental drivers of change are expected to be (a) disturbance deviation beyond the historical norm and (b) vegetation morphodynamics, a key river process where ecological and fluvial-geomorphological attributes interact to shape the physical environment. Increased seasonal temperature, summer drought, and winter flooding may affect the colonisation, growth, and mortality of plant species with consequences for riverscape structure and function as succession patterns adjust with repercussions for hydraulics and sediment dynamics. Such opposing winter and summer climate regimes are likely to impact vegetation patch dynamics, reflected in an increasingly variable patch mosaic as disturbance intensity deviates further from historical background conditions. How changes to climate drivers manifest themselves in individual river systems will also be affected by attributes such as catchment topography, geology, vegetation type, and previous human alterations. Where large scale change occurs, it will have consequences for the type and function of biological communities inhabiting the riverscape. Conventional engineering responses to meteorological disturbance will amplify the effect on river biota by reducing their ecological resilience, highlighting the need for a management response that integrates ecological and societal benefits simultaneously.},

  abstract = {In the spawning environment of salmonids, the quality of the intergravel flow is an essential abiotic requirement for the survival success of incubated embryos. As one of the most frequently investigated anthropogenic environmental impacts, the enhanced mobilization of fine sediments ({$<$}1\,mm) and their entry into riverine ecosystems is considered as a major cause for the degradation of a variety of biological processes and habitats, including the spawning habitats of salmonids. In catchments draining crystalline bedrock, however, like the Bohemian Massif in the northern part of Austria, the excessive loading of river channels with coarse sand and fine gravel sediments (D\,=\,1-10\,mm) and less cohesive than fines is common as a consequence of altered catchment landuse. Here, far less understanding exists for the mechanism and the possible implications of coarse sand infiltration on the functioning of the intergravel flow in salmonid redds. To investigate the intergravel flow hydraulics in response to coarse sand infiltration (D50\,=\,2\,mm) in brown trout spawning redds (Salmo trutta fario) under controlled conditions, a laboratory flume experiment with three infiltration scenarios was conducted: (1) no infiltration, (2) segmental infiltration and (3) full section infiltration. A more than two times drop in the average intergravel flow velocity was documented from scenario 1 (5.85 cms-1) to scenario 2 (2.53 cms-1) and another clear reduction was seen from scenario 2 (2.53 cms-1) to scenario 3 (1.61 cms-1). Moreover, in scenario 3, a clear reduction of the intergravel flow traveling distance was observed. Based on the findings we conclude that future considerations regarding the sustainable catchment management of salmonid fisheries should include programs to reduce not only the excessive entry of fines, but, in the relevant catchments, also the entry of excessive coarse sand into the riverine ecosystem.

The basis is a solution to the equations for conservation of mass and momentum and for lateral stability of the streambed. The bed-stability equation is a transverse force balance for bed-sediment particles relating the transverse bed slope to primary flow variables. The main controlling parameters are the channel's width-depth ratio, radius-width ratio, resistance characteristics (or gradient), and sediment Froude number. An innovative feature is the use of a simple mass-flux balance (mass conservation) to link the equation for bed stability to the momentum equations. The mass-flux balance relates the net lateral transport of flow volume to the streamwise variation of transverse bed slope. Thereby, the equations governing the secondary-current velocity and the transverse bed slope become those of a damped oscillating system subjected to a driving force, the change in channel curvature. The model is tested with both laboratory and field data.},

The objective of this paper is to analyse the temporal variability in suspended sediment transport and yield in that catchment. Analyses were also undertaken to assess the relationships between precipitation, discharge and suspended sediment transport, and to interpret sediment delivery processes using suspended sediment-discharge hysteresis patterns. During the study period, we analysed 17 flood events, with high resolution suspended sediment data derived from continuous turbidity and automatic sampling. The results revealed strong seasonal, annual and inter-annual variability in suspended sediment transport. Sediment was strongly transported during spring, when frequent flood events of high magnitude and intensity occurred. Annual sediment transport in 2007 yielded 16 614 tonnes, representing 15 t km-2 (85\% of annual load transport during floods for 16\% of annual duration), while the 2008 sediment yield was 77 960 tonnes, representing 70 t km-2 (95\% of annual load transport during floods for 20\% of annual duration). Analysis of the relationships between precipitation, discharge and suspended sediment transport showed that there were significant correlations between total precipitation, peak discharge, total water yield, flood intensity and sediment variables during the flood events, but no relationship with antecedent conditions. Flood events were classified in relation to suspended sediment concentration (SSC){\textendash}discharge hysteretic loops, complemented with temporal dynamics of SSC{\textendash}discharge ranges during rising and falling flow. The hysteretic shapes obtained for all flood events reflected the distribution of probable sediment sources throughout the catchment. Regarding the sediment transport during all flood events, clockwise hysteretic loops represented 68\% from river deposited sediments and nearby source areas, anticlockwise 29\% from distant source areas, and simultaneity of SSC and discharge 3\%.},

A new renormalization-based formulation involving wide accuracy improvements of the scheme is introduced. The classical SPH and renormalized approaches are compared to the new method using simple test cases, thus outlining the efficiency of this new improved SPH method. Finally, the so-called ``tensile instability'' is shown to be prevented by this enhanced SPH method, through accuracy increases in the gradient approximations.},

The concept of virtual water and the quantitative estimates can help in assessing a more realistic water scarcity index in each country, projecting future water demand for food supply, increasing public awareness on water, and identifying the processes wasting water in the production. Really required water in exporting countries is generally smaller than virtually required water in importing countries, reflecting the comparative advantage of water use efficiency, and it is estimated to be 680 km3/y for 2000. On the contrary the virtually required water for the same year is estimated to be 1,130 km3/y, and the difference of 450 km3/y is virtually saved by global trade. However, solely virtual water should not be used for any decision making since the idea of virtual water implies only the usage and influence of water and no concerns on social, cultural, and environmental implications. Virtual water trade also does not consider other limiting factors than water.}

  abstract = {Water is a naturally circulating resource that is constantly recharged. Therefore, even though the stocks of water in natural and artificial reservoirs are helpful to increase the available water resources for human society, the flow of water should be the main focus in water resources assessments. The climate system puts an upper limit on the circulation rate of available renewable freshwater resources (RFWR). Although current global withdrawals are well below the upper limit, more than two billion people live in highly water-stressed areas because of the uneven distribution of RFWR in time and space. Climate change is expected to accelerate water cycles and thereby increase the available RFWR. This would slow down the increase of people living under water stress; however, changes in seasonal patterns and increasing probability of extreme events may offset this effect. Reducing current vulnerability will be the first step to prepare for such anticipated changes.},

  abstract = {We discuss the arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC), which has been subject of research in a few recent theoretical papers. Like all polynomial chaos expansion techniques, aPC approximates the dependence of simulation model output on model parameters by expansion in an orthogonal polynomial basis. The aPC generalizes chaos expansion techniques towards arbitrary distributions with arbitrary probability measures, which can be either discrete, continuous, or discretized continuous and can be specified either analytically (as probability density/cumulative distribution functions), numerically as histogram or as raw data sets. We show that the aPC at finite expansion order only demands the existence of a finite number of moments and does not require the complete knowledge or even existence of a probability density function. This avoids the necessity to assign parametric probability distributions that are not sufficiently supported by limited available data. Alternatively, it allows modellers to choose freely of technical constraints the shapes of their statistical assumptions. Our key idea is to align the complexity level and order of analysis with the reliability and detail level of statistical information on the input parameters. We provide conditions for existence and clarify the relation of the aPC to statistical moments of model parameters. We test the performance of the aPC with diverse statistical distributions and with raw data. In these exemplary test cases, we illustrate the convergence with increasing expansion order and, for the first time, with increasing reliability level of statistical input information. Our results indicate that the aPC shows an exponential convergence rate and converges faster than classical polynomial chaos expansion techniques.},

We align Bayesian model evidence (BME) with relative entropy and cross entropy in order to simplify computations using prior-based (Monte Carlo) or posterior-based (Markov chain Monte Carlo) BME estimates. On the one hand, we demonstrate how Bayesian model selection can profit from information theory to estimate BME values via posterior-based techniques. Hence, we use various assumptions including relations to several information criteria. On the other hand, we demonstrate how relative entropy can profit from BME to assess information entropy during Bayesian updating and to assess utility in Bayesian experimental design. Specifically, we emphasize that relative entropy can be computed avoiding unnecessary multidimensional integration from both prior and posterior-based sampling techniques. Prior-based computation does not require any assumptions, however posterior-based estimates require at least one assumption. We illustrate the performance of the discussed estimates of BME, information entropy and experiment utility using a transparent, non-linear example. The multivariate Gaussian posterior estimate includes least assumptions and shows the best performance for BME estimation, information entropy and experiment utility from posterior-based sampling.},

  abstract = {Gaussian process emulators (GPE) are a machine learning approach that replicates computational demanding models using training runs of that model. Constructing such a surrogate is very challenging and, in the context of Bayesian inference, the training runs should be well invested. The current paper offers a fully Bayesian view on GPEs for Bayesian inference accompanied by Bayesian active learning (BAL). We introduce three BAL strategies that adaptively identify training sets for the GPE using information-theoretic arguments. The first strategy relies on Bayesian model evidence that indicates the GPE's quality of matching the measurement data, the second strategy is based on relative entropy that indicates the relative information gain for the GPE, and the third is founded on information entropy that indicates the missing information in the GPE. We illustrate the performance of our three strategies using analytical- and carbon-dioxide benchmarks. The paper shows evidence of convergence against a reference solution and demonstrates quantification of post-calibration uncertainty by comparing the introduced three strategies. We conclude that Bayesian model evidence-based and relative entropy-based strategies outperform the entropy-based strategy because the latter can be misleading during the BAL. The relative entropy-based strategy demonstrates superior performance to the Bayesian model evidence-based strategy.},

Maintaining a plant's health is a key factor in its continued existence. As minute as rhizospheric microbes are, their importance in plant growth cannot be overemphasized. They depend on plants for nutrients and other necessary requirements. The relationship between the rhizosphere-microbiome (rhizobiome) and plant hosts can be beneficial, non-effectual, or pathogenic depending on the microbes and the plant involved. This relationship, to a large extent, determines the fate of the host plant's survival. Modern molecular techniques have been used to unravel rhizobiome species' composition, but the interplay between the rhizobiome root exudates and other factors in the maintenance of a healthy plant have not as yet been thoroughly investigated. Many functional proteins are activated in plants upon contact with external factors. These proteins may elicit growth promoting or growth suppressing responses from the plants. To optimize the growth and productivity of host plants, rhizobiome microbial diversity and modulatory techniques need to be clearly understood for improved plant health.},

The current technologies are not able to convert solar energy into electricity with high performance. The ten\- dency is to generate new methods that enhance the design of devices for solar energy conversion. Solar cells are devices that convert solar energy into electrical energy with low cost and easy large-scale manufacturing ca\- pabilities. However, such devices have a high degree of nonlinearity, and they possess parameters that must be accurately selected. Considering the above traditional computational methods are used to obtain solar cells parameters are cumbersome with many limitations. This paper presents a review of different meta-heuristics techniques, including Genetic Algorithms, Harmony Search, Artificial Bee Colony, Simulated Annealing, Cat Swarm Optimization, Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimization, Advanced Bee Swarm Optimization, Whale Optimization Algorithm, Gravitational Search Algorithm, Flower Pollination Algorithm, Shuffled Complex Evolution, and Wind-Driven Optimization. Such methods are applied to solar cell parameters estimation which may be beneficial to enhance the efficiency of such devices.

Much ecosystem monitoring and management is focused on the provision of ecosystem functions and services under current environmental conditions, yet this could lead to inappropriate management guidance and undervaluation of the importance of biodiversity. The maintenance of ecosystem functions and services under substantial predicted future environmental change (i.e., their `resilience') is crucial. Here we identify a range of mechanisms underpinning the resilience of ecosystem functions across three ecological scales. Although potentially less important in the short term, biodiversity, encompassing variation from within species to across landscapes, may be crucial for the longer-term resilience of ecosystem functions and the services that they underpin.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of the current study was to present a 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model that can be used to predict long-term (11 years) bed changes in a reservoir due to sedimentation and dredging and that can be done with a reasonable computational time (18 h) on a desktop computer. Materials and methods The numerical model solved the Navier-Stokes equations on a 3D non-orthogonal unstructured grid to find the water velocities and turbulence. The convection-diffusion equation for suspended sediment transport was solved to find the sediment deposition pattern. Bed changes were computed and used to adjust the grid over time. Thereby, bed elevations over time were computed. The effect of dredging was also included in the model, and how this affected the bed elevation changes. The main feature of the numerical model enabling a reasonable computational time was implicit numerical methods giving the possibility to use long time steps. Results and discussion The results were compared with annually measured bed elevation changes in the reservoir over 11 years. This gave 11 figures of bed elevation changes, due to the combined effect of sedimentation and dredging. Comparing the annually computed and measured bed changes, there was a fair agreement for most of the years. The main deposition patterns were reproduced. The amount of sediments removed in three dredging campaigns were also computed numerically and compared with the measured values. Parameter tests were done for the grid size, fall velocity of the sediments, cohesion, and sediment transport formula. The deviation between computed and measured dredged sediment volumes was less than 16\% for all these four parameters/formulas. Conclusions The 3D CFD numerical model was able to compute water flow, sediment transport, and bed elevation changes in a hydropower reservoir over a time period of 11 years. Field measurements showed reasonable agreement with the computed bed elevation changes. The results were most sensitive to the sediment particle fall velocity and cohesion of the bed material.},

CMA-ES is a robust local optimiser that has shown great performance on small-scale nonseparable optimisation problems. Self-adaptation of a covariance matrix makes it rotational invariant which is a desirable property, especially for solving non-separable problems. The focus of this paper is to compare the performance of CMA-ES with Cooperative Co-evolutionary Algorithms (CCEAs) for large scale global optimisation (on problems with up to 1000 real-valued variables). Since the original CMA-ES is incapable of handling problems with more than several hundreds dimensions, sep-CMA-ES was developed using only the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix. In this paper sep-CMA-ES is compared with several existing CCEAs. Experimental results revealed that the performance of sep-CMA-ES drops significantly when the dimensionality of the problem increases. However, our results suggest that the rotational invariant property of CMA-ES can be utilised in conjunction with a CCEA to further enhance its capability to handle large scale optimisation problems.},

  abstract = {Experiments were performed to evaluate short-term changes in sediment extracellular carbohydrates for a multispecific assemblage of benthic diatoms in relation to physiological status, endogenous migratory rhythms, and environmental conditions. For this purpose, a mesocosm was used, which simulated both tidal and dark: light alternating cycles under controlled conditions. Scanning electronic microscopy in combination with picture analyses indicated that natural diatom migration patterns were reproduced in the mesocosm. Two EPS fractions were operationally separated in colloidal carbohydrate measurements: alcohol-soluble EPS (termed "soluble EPS") and alcohol-insoluble EPS (termed "bound EPS"). Microphytobenthic biomass followed a logistic-type curve and converged toward a maximal value termed the "biotic capacity of the local environment." Both EPS fractions showed oscillations with production during photosynthetic periods and sharp decreases during night immersion periods. Productions of both EPS fractions increased with Chl a production during light periods suggesting a light dependence in relation to migratory patterns. The decreases in both EPS fractions, which occurred during night immersion periods suggest that carbohydrate hydrolysis and/or washaway affected both EPS fractions similarly in benthic environments. Our results confirm the theory according to which the two distinct fractions are under different metabolic controls. No change in soluble EPS release was obtained during the transition from logarithmic to stationary phase. On the other hand, a metabolism modification of microalgae, probably related to ammonium depletion, occurred when cells entered the stationary phase, since there was a high enhancement in bound EPS production. Mesocosm results can serve as a system of reference useful to characterize biofilm development in field investigations and to revisit the effective implication of each EPS fraction in sediment stability.},

  abstract = {Insight is provided in hydrodynamic processes governing the velocity redistribution in sharp river bends based on simulations of three recent experiments by means of Blanckaert and de Vriend's (2003, 2010) reduced-order nonlinear model without curvature restrictions. This model successfully simulated the flow redistribution and the secondary flow in all three experiments. The results indicate that the flow redistribution is primarily governed by topographic steering, curvature variations and secondary flow, in a broad range of different configurations, including mildly to sharply curved bends, narrow to shallow bends, smooth to rough bends, bends with additional complexities such as horizontal recirculation zones or patches of riverbed vegetation. The relative importance of these three dominant processes is case dependent, and controlled by the parameters Cf-1H/B, R/B and streamwise curvature variations. The first parameter characterizes a river reach, whereas the second and third parameters are characteristics of individual bends. Major differences exist between the hydrodynamic processes in mildly and sharply curved bends. First, velocity redistribution induced by curvature variations is negligible in mildly curved bends, but the dominant process in sharp bends. This result is relevant, because most meander models are based on the assumption of weak-curvature variations. Second, nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions play a dominant role in sharp bends, where mild-curvature models overpredict the secondary flow and in some cases even falsely identify it as the dominant process governing the velocity redistribution, which leads to unsatisfactory flow predictions. The reduction in secondary flow strength provoked by the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions is accompanied by a reduction in the transverse bed slope, which reduces the effect of topographic steering.},

  abstract = {The flow through meander bends is inherently three dimensional and may be characterized by primary flow in streamwise direction and secondary flow in transverse direction. Although, three dimensional simulations of meander bends are feasible for laboratory scale experiments, temporal and spatial scales of naturally occurring meandering rivers are much larger than those found in laboratory experiments. Therefore, computationally less expensive (reduced) flow models are necessary. Reduced hydrodynamic models are depth-integrated models and therefore require a closure model to resolve the effect of secondary flow. At present, most reduced flow models are linear as they neglect the feedback between the primary and secondary flow, which limits their validity to mild curvature. A non-linear reduced flow model, including this feedback, is compared to experimental data from the laboratory and the field which are both sharply and moderately curved. The model predictions compare well to the global flow structure in the high curvature Kinoshita flume and the moderate curvature Tollense River bend (with extra complicating factors of vegetation and horizontal recirculation zones). A linear model is also used to model the selected cases, showing good agreement for moderate curvature but not for sharp curvature. An analysis of the driving mechanisms reveals the reason for the difference in the model predictions.},

  abstract = {Extreme climatic conditions likely caused a massive fish mortality during the summer of 2001 in the St. Lawrence River. To corroborate this hypothesis, we used a physical habitat simulation approach incorporating hydraulic and water temperature models. Spawning Habitat Suitability Indices (HSI) for common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were developed using fuzzy logic and applied to the model outputs to estimate habitat weighted usable area during the event. The results revealed that areas suitable for common carp spawning (HSI {$>$} 0.3) were severely reduced by high water temperatures, which exceeded 28 {\textdegree}C during the mortality event. During the mortality event, the amount of suitable habitat was reduced to {$<$}200 ha/day, representing less than 15\% of the maximum potential suitable habitat in the study reach. In addition, the availability of cooler habitats that could have been used as thermal refuges was also reduced. These results indicate that the high water temperature in spawning areas and reduced accessibility to thermal refuge habitats exposed the carp to substantial physiological and environmental stress. The high water temperatures were highly detrimental to the fish and eventually led to the observed mortalities. This study demonstrates the importance of including water temperature in habitat suitability models.},

  abstract = {Most inverse problems in the industry (and particularly in geophysical exploration) are highly underdetermined because the number of model parameters too high to achieve accurate data predictions and because the sampling of the data space is scarce and incomplete; it is always affected by different kinds of noise. Additionally, the physics of the forward problem is a simplification of the reality. All these facts result in that the inverse problem solution is not unique; that is, there are different inverse solutions (called equivalent), compatible with the prior information that fits the observed data within similar error bounds. In the case of nonlinear inverse problems, these equivalent models are located in disconnected flat curvilinear valleys of the cost-function topography. The uncertainty analysis consists of obtaining a representation of this complex topography via different sampling methodologies. In this paper, we focus on the use of a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to sample the region of equivalence in nonlinear inverse problems. Although this methodology has a general purpose, we show its application for the uncertainty assessment of the solution of a geophysical problem concerning gravity inversion in sedimentary basins, showing that it is possible to efficiently perform this task in a sampling-while-optimizing mode. Particularly, we explain how to use and analyze the geophysical models sampled by exploratory PSO family members to infer different descriptors of nonlinear uncertainty.},

  abstract = {1. Stream ecosystems are increasingly impacted by multiple stressors that lead to a loss of sensitive species and an overall reduction in diversity. A dominant paradigm in ecological restoration is that increasing habitat heterogeneity (HH) promotes restoration of biodiversity. This paradigm is reflected in stream restoration projects through the common practice of re-configuring channels to add meanders and adding physical structures such as boulders and artificial riffles to restore biodiversity by enhancing structural heterogeneity. 2. To evaluate the validity of this paradigm, we completed an extensive evaluation of published studies that have quantitatively examined the reach-scale response of invertebrate species richness to restoration actions that increased channel complexity/HH. We also evaluated studies that used manipulative or correlative approaches to test for a relationship between physical heterogeneity and invertebrate diversity in streams that were not in need of restoration. 3. We found habitat and macroinvertebrate data for 78 independent stream or river restoration projects described by 18 different author groups in which invertebrate taxa richness data in response to the restoration treatment were available. Most projects were successful in enhancing physical HH; however, only two showed statistically significant increases in biodiversity rendering them more similar to reference reaches or sites. 4. Studies manipulating structural complexity in otherwise healthy streams were generally small in scale and less than half showed a significant positive relationship with invertebrate diversity. Only one-third of the studies that attempted to correlate biodiversity to existing levels of in-stream heterogeneity found a positive relationship. 5. Across all the studies we evaluated, there is no evidence that HH was the primary factor controlling stream invertebrate diversity, particularly in a restoration context. The findings indicate that physical heterogeneity should not be the driving force in selecting restoration approaches for most degraded waterways. Evidence suggests that much more must be done to restore streams impacted by multiple stressors than simply re-configuring channels and enhancing structural complexity with meanders, boulders, wood, or other structures. 6. Thematic implications: as integrators of all activities on the land, streams are sensitive to a host of stressors including impacts from urbanisation, agriculture, deforestation, invasive species, flow regulation, water extractions and mining. The impacts of these individually or in combination typically lead to a decrease in biodiversity because of reduced water quality, biologically unsuitable flow regimes, dispersal barriers, altered inputs of organic matter or sunlight, degraded habitat, etc. Despite the complexity of these stressors, a large number of stream restoration projects focus primarily on physical channel characteristics. We show that this is not a wise investment if ecological recovery is the goal. Managers should critically diagnose the stressors impacting an impaired stream and invest resources first in repairing those problems most likely to limit restoration.},

  abstract = {The greatest obstacle to soil erosion modelling at larger spatial scales is the lack of data on soil characteristics. One key parameter for modelling soil erosion is the soil erodibility, expressed as the K-factor in the widely used soil erosion model, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its revised version (RUSLE). The K-factor, which expresses the susceptibility of a soil to erode, is related to soil properties such as organic matter content, soil texture, soil structure and permeability. With the Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) soil survey in 2009 a pan-European soil dataset is available for the first time, consisting of around 20,000 points across 25 Member States of the European Union. The aim of this study is the generation of a harmonised high-resolution soil erodibility map (with a grid cell size of 500 m) for the 25 EU Member States. Soil erodibility was calculated for the LUCAS survey points using the nomograph of Wischmeier and Smith (1978). A Cubist regression model was applied to correlate spatial data such as latitude, longitude, remotely sensed and terrain features in order to develop a high-resolution soil erodibility map. The mean K-factor for Europe was estimated at 0.032 t ha h ha-1 MJ-1 mm-1 with a standard deviation of 0.009 t ha h ha-1 MJ-1 mm-1. The yielded soil erodibility dataset compared well with the published local and regional soil erodibility data. However, the incorporation of the protective effect of surface stone cover, which is usually not considered for the soil erodibility calculations, resulted in an average 15\% decrease of the K-factor. The exclusion of this effect in K-factor calculations is likely to result in an overestimation of soil erosion, particularly for the Mediterranean countries, where highest percentages of surface stone cover were observed.},

  abstract = {Land use and management influence the magnitude of soil loss. Among the different soil erosion risk factors, the cover-management factor (C-factor) is the one that policy makers and farmers can most readily influence in order to help reduce soil loss rates. The present study proposes a methodology for estimating the C-factor in the European Union (EU), using pan-European datasets (such as CORINE Land Cover), biophysical attributes derived from remote sensing, and statistical data on agricultural crops and practices. In arable lands, the C-factor was estimated using crop statistics (\% of land per crop) and data on management practices such as conservation tillage, plant residues and winter crop cover. The C-factor in non-arable lands was estimated by weighting the range of literature values found according to fractional vegetation cover, which was estimated based on the remote sensing dataset Fcover. The mean C-factor in the EU is estimated to be 0.1043, with an extremely high variability; forests have the lowest mean C-factor (0.00116), and arable lands and sparsely vegetated areas the highest (0.233 and 0.2651, respectively). Conservation management practices (reduced/no tillage, use of cover crops and plant residues) reduce the C-factor by on average 19.1\% in arable lands.},

The S-factor measures the effect of slope steepness, and the L-factor defines the impact of slope length. The combined LS-factor describes the effect of topography on soil erosion. The European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) developed a new pan-European high-resolution soil erosion assessment to achieve a better understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of soil erosion in Europe. The LS-calculation was performed using the original equation proposed by Desmet and Govers (1996) and implemented using the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA), which incorporates a multiple flow algorithm and contributes to a precise estimation of flow accumulation. The LS-factor dataset was calculated using a high-resolution (25 m) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the whole European Union, resulting in an improved delineation of areas at risk of soil erosion as compared to lower-resolution datasets. This combined approach of using GIS software tools with high-resolution DEMs has been successfully applied in regional assessments in the past, and is now being applied for first time at the European scale.},

  abstract = {Soil erosion by water is one of the major threats to soils in the European Union, with a negative impact on ecosystem services, crop production, drinking water and carbon stocks. The European Commission's Soil Thematic Strategy has identified soil erosion as a relevant issue for the European Union, and has proposed an approach to monitor soil erosion. This paper presents the application of a modified version of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model (RUSLE2015) to estimate soil loss in Europe for the reference year 2010, within which the input factors (Rainfall erosivity, Soil erodibility, Cover-Management, Topography, Support practices) are modelled with the most recently available pan-European datasets. While RUSLE has been used before in Europe, RUSLE2015 improves the quality of estimation by introducing updated (2010), high-resolution (100m), peer-reviewed input layers. The mean soil loss rate in the European Union's erosion-prone lands (agricultural, forests and semi-natural areas) was found to be 2.46 t ha-1 yr-1, resulting in a total soil loss of 970 Mt annually. A major benefit of RUSLE2015 is that it can incorporate the effects of policy scenarios based on land-use changes and support practices. The impact of the Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) requirements of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the EU's guidelines for soil protection can be grouped under land management (reduced/no till, plant residues, cover crops) and support practices (contour farming, maintenance of stone walls and grass margins). The policy interventions (GAEC, Soil Thematic Strategy) over the past decade have reduced the soil loss rate by 9.5\% on average in Europe, and by 20\% for arable lands. Special attention is given to the 4 million ha of croplands which currently have unsustainable soil loss rates of more than 5 t ha-1 yr-1, and to which policy measures should be targeted.},

  abstract = {Rainfall is one the main drivers of soil erosion. The erosive force of rainfall is expressed as rainfall erosivity. Rainfall erosivity considers the rainfall amount and intensity, and is most commonly expressed as the R-factor in the USLE model and its revised version, RUSLE. At national and continental levels, the scarce availability of data obliges soil erosion modellers to estimate this factor based on rainfall data with only low temporal resolution (daily, monthly, annual averages). The purpose of this study is to assess rainfall erosivity in Europe in the form of the RUSLE R-factor, based on the best available datasets. Data have been collected from 1541 precipitation stations in all European Union (EU) Member States and Switzerland, with temporal resolutions of 5 to 60min. The R-factor values calculated from precipitation data of different temporal resolutions were normalised to R-factor values with temporal resolutions of 30min using linear regression functions. Precipitation time series ranged from a minimum of 5years to a maximum of 40years. The average time series per precipitation station is around 17.1years, the most datasets including the first decade of the 21st century. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) has been used to interpolate the R-factor station values to a European rainfall erosivity map at 1km resolution. The covariates used for the R-factor interpolation were climatic data (total precipitation, seasonal precipitation, precipitation of driest/wettest months, average temperature), elevation and latitude/longitude. The mean R-factor for the EU plus Switzerland is 722MJmmha-1h-1yr-1, with the highest values ({$>$}1000MJmmha-1h-1yr-1) in the Mediterranean and alpine regions and the lowest ({$<$}500MJmmha-1h-1yr-1) in the Nordic countries. The erosivity density (erosivity normalised to annual precipitation amounts) was also the highest in Mediterranean regions which implies high risk for erosive events and floods.},

  abstract = {Rainfall erosivity considers the effects of rainfall amount and intensity on soil detachment. Rainfall erosivity is most commonly expressed as the R-factor in the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its revised version, RUSLE. Several studies focus on spatial analysis of rainfall erosivity ignoring the intra-annual variability of this factor. This study assesses rainfall erosivity in Greece on a monthly basis in the form of the RUSLE R-factor, based on a 30-min data from 80 precipitation stations covering an average period of almost 30 years. The spatial interpolation was done through a Generalised Additive Model (GAM). The observed intra-annual variability of rainfall erosivity proved to be high. The warm season is 3 times less erosive than the cold one. November, December and October are the most erosive months contrary to July, August and May which are the least erosive. The proportion between rainfall erosivity and precipitation, expressed as erosivity density, varies throughout the year. Erosivity density is low in the first 5 months (January{\textendash}May) and is relatively high in the remaining 7 months (June{\textendash}December) of the year. The R-factor maps reveal also a high spatial variability with elevated values in the western Greece and Peloponnesus and very low values in Western Macedonia, Thessaly, Attica and Cyclades. The East{\textendash}West gradient of rainfall erosivity differs per month with a smoother distribution in summer and a more pronounced gradient during the winter months. The aggregated data for the 12 months result in an average Rfactor of 807 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 year-1 with a range from 84 to 2825 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 year-1. The combination of monthly R-factor maps with vegetation coverage and tillage maps contributes to better monitor soil erosion risk at national level and monthly basis.},

While water erosion is identified as the most serious cause of soil degradation globally, global patterns of rainfall erosivity remain poorly quantified and estimates have large uncertainties. This hampers the implementation of effective soil degradation mitigation and restoration strategies. Quantifying rainfall erosivity is challenging as it requires high temporal resolution({$<$}30\,min) and high fidelity rainfall recordings. We present the results of an extensive global data collection effort whereby we estimated rainfall erosivity for 3,625 stations covering 63 countries. This first ever Global Rainfall Erosivity Database was used to develop a global erosivity map at 30 arc-seconds({\textasciitilde}1\,km) based on a Gaussian Process Regression(GPR). Globally, the mean rainfall erosivity was estimated to be 2,190 MJ mm ha-1 h-1 yr-1, with the highest values in South America and the Caribbean countries, Central east Africa and South east Asia. The lowest values are mainly found in Canada, the Russian Federation, Northern Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. The tropical climate zone has the highest mean rainfall erosivity followed by the temperate whereas the lowest mean was estimated in the cold climate zone.},

Here, we present a comprehensive set of future erosivity projections at a 30 arc-second ({$\sim$}1km2) spatial scale using 19 downscaled General Circulation Models (GCMs) simulating three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for the periods 2041-2060 and 2061-2080. The future rainfall erosivity projections were obtained based on a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) approach relating rainfall depth to rainfall erosivity through a series of (bio)climatic covariates. Compared to the 2010 Global Rainfall erosivity baseline, we estimate a potential average increase in global rainfall erosivity between 26.2-28.8\% for 2050 and 27-34.3\% for 2070. Therefore, climate change and the consequential increase in rainfall erosivity is the main driver of the projected +30-66\% increase in soil erosion rates by 2070. Our results were successfully compared with 20 regional studies addressing the rainfall erosivity projections. We release the whole dataset of future rainfall erosivity projections composed of 102 simulation scenarios, with the aim to support further research activities on soil erosion, soil conservation and climate change communities. We expect these datasets to address the needs of both the Earth system modeling community and policy makers. In addition, we introduce a modeling approach to estimate future erosivity and make further assessments at global and continental scales.},

In this study, assessment of uncertainty in soil erosion modelling of the Karso watershed, India, was carried out by employing the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and geospatial technologies to evaluate the effect of multi-source digital elevation models (DEMs) [Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Cartosat and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)] with resampled multi-resolution grids. The rainfall erosivity factor (R) was computed using the mean monthly Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission rainfall estimates for 1998 to 2012. The slope length factor was derived using the ASTER and Cartosat DEMs at grid sizes of 30~m, 50~m, 100~m, 150~m, 200~m, and 250~m, and for the SRTM DEM at 100~m, 150~m, 200~m and 250~m resolutions for the Karso watershed, Jharkhand, India. Significant differences were obtained in the soil loss estimates across the different DEM sources and resampled grid sizes. The Cartosat DEM with a 200~m grid was found to estimate the soil loss the best out of all the DEM combinations considered. The Cartosat DEM proved to be more reliable than the ASTER and SRTM DEMs. The results indicated that the RUSLE is a scale-dependent model since the model estimates were affected not only by the DEM source but also by its resolution. The prediction of erosion potential by employing the multisource, multiresolution DEMs and the RUSLE helped to identify the soil erosion's spatial pattern within the watershed. The study provided an impact analysis of the uncertainties when selecting the multisource, multiresolution DEMs for soil erosion modelling.},

For this purpose, we acquire RGB images of the individual stones and of the wall during the construction phase. In our framework, we use structure from motion (SfM) to first generate 3D source and destination models, which are then registered to form the GDT through non-linear least squares and 2D point feature correspondences detected on the SfM images. This method contrasts with traditional techniques that register point clouds using 3D point descriptors. Because of the robustness of image feature descriptors, we found that using 2D instead of 3D point features facilitates the automation of the GDT generation. To benchmark our algorithm, we compared the results through an Euclidean{\textendash}distance-based proposed metric with a known 3D textured model from which images were synthetically generated. We show the robustness and feasibility of our method for full size elements, wherein GDTs were generated for dry-stone and stone-mortar systems. This study allows researchers to produce accurate representations of the 3D geometry of walls built for experimental research, reducing therefore uncertainties related to the stone size, shape and arrangement to a minimum when comparing 3D numerical simulations of these walls to experimental results.

For the investigations the Reynoldsnumber as well as the distance between the tip and the divider wall (tip distance) are varied. While the Reynolds number varies from 50'000 to 200'000 and its influence on the normalized pressure loss and heat transfer is found to be small, the variations of the tip distance from 0.5 up to 3.65 W produce quite different flow structures in the bend. The pressure loss over the bend thus shows a strong dependency on these variations.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty analysis of models has received increasing attention over the last two decades in water resources research. However, a significant part of the community is still reluctant to embrace the estimation of uncertainty in hydrological and hydraulic modeling. In this paper, we summarize and explore seven common arguments: uncertainty analysis is not necessary given physically realistic models; uncertainty analysis cannot be used in hydrological and hydraulic hypothesis testing; uncertainty (probability) distributions cannot be understood by policy makers and the public; uncertainty analysis cannot be incorporated into the decision-making process; uncertainty analysis is too subjective; uncertainty analysis is too difficult to perform; uncertainty does not really matter in making the final decision. We will argue that none of the arguments against uncertainty analysis rehearsed are, in the end, tenable. Moreover, we suggest that one reason why the application of uncertainty analysis is not normal and expected part of modeling practice is that mature guidance on methods and applications does not exist. The paper concludes with suggesting that a Code of Practice is needed as a way of formalizing such guidance.},

We compare the predictions of a 2D flood inundation model obtained using different global and local evaluation criteria. It is shown that traditional area averaging performance measures are inadequate in the face of model imperfection, especially when such models are calibrated for flood hazard studies. In this study we include flood risk weighting into the performance measure of the model. This allows us to calibrate the model to places that are important, e.g. location of houses.

Yet, information necessary to derive exposure in terms of monetary value at the level of individual houses is often not available. This includes building type, size, quality, or age. In this study, we provide a universal method for estimating exposure of residential assets using only publicly available or open data. Using building footprints (polygons) from OpenStreetMap as a starting point, we utilized high-resolution elevation models of 30 European capitals and pan-European raster datasets to construct a Bayesian-network-based model that is able to predict building height. The model was then validated with a dataset of (1) buildings in Poland endangered by sea level rise, for which the number of floors is known, and (2) a sample of Dutch and German houses affected in the past by fluvial and pluvial floods, for which usable floor space area is known. Floor space of buildings is an important basis for approximating their economic value, including household contents. Here, we provide average national-level gross replacement costs of the stock of residential assets in 30 European countries, in nominal and real prices, covering the years 2000{\textendash}2017. We either relied on existing estimates of the total stock of assets or made new calculations using the perpetual inventory method, which were then translated into exposure per square metre of floor space using data on countries' dwelling stocks. The study shows that the resulting standardized residential exposure values provide much better coverage and consistency compared to previous studies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The design proposed here builds upon the Instream Flow Incremental Methodology but is focused at the need for managing large-scale habitats and river systems. It modifies the data acquisition technique and analytical resolution of standard approaches, changing the scale of physical parameters and biological response assessment from micro- to meso-scale. In terms of technological process, a highly detailed microhabitat survey of a few, short sampling sites would be replaced by mesohabitat mapping of whole-river sections. As with more traditional stream habitat models, the variation in the spatial distribution and amount of mesohabitats can provide key information on habitat quality changes corresponding to alterations in flow, channel changes, and stream improvement measures. However, the scale of simulations more closely matches restoration and system analyses, because it provides a solid base for quantitative assessment and simulation of habitat conditions for the whole stream.},

The integration of these models into management practices at the river and watershed scale would therefore require corresponding modifications in both the models and results. Such procedures fall into three major categories: biological, spatial and temporal upscaling. Biological upscaling develops methods for applying habitat models to aquatic communities, as opposed to individual indicator species. Spatial upscaling creates a hierarchical framework through which to translate habitat observations from the species to management scale. Temporal upscaling incorporates biological and hydro-morphological dynamics into the static model. In the following paper the upscaling concept will be described in greater detail, illustrating its application with the example of the Quinebaug River in New England.}

The amount of water necessary to achieve the required habitat levels was calculated for various river restoration scenarios. We also created a set of detailed rules for a habitat augmentation release that applies short `pulses' of water to increase habitat availability and mitigate the effects of persistent drought conditions. A set of flow chart templates was developed to guide the planning of an augmentation scheme by utilizing flow releases from reservoirs. To test our augmentation procedures, we performed evaluation tests by applying the rules to flows that occurred in 1994 (a drought year). The test showed that the number of flow interventions necessary was limited, underlining the feasibility of a pulse-based approach. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Quantification of the potential habitat available for endangered freshwater mussels can be a challenging task, as habitat use criteria are very complex and often only low numbers of species observations are available. To address this problem in a riverine environment, we developed a concept of a multivariate, multi-scale, and multi-model (multiplex) habitat simulation through combining multivariate time-series analysis of complex hydraulics (CART and logistic regression), micro-scale (River2D), and meso-scale (MesoHABSIM) habitat models, to develop macro-scale management criteria. This concept has been applied and tested on the Upper Delaware River (USA) for the protection and enhancement of existing populations of Alasmidonta heterodon, an endangered freshwater mussel. The physical habitat conditions of approximately 125km of the Delaware River were described using digital aerial imagery and ground-based surveys. The temporal and spatial variabilities of complex hydraulics simulated by a River2D model at 1547 locations were statistically analyzed to select ranges of attributes that corresponded to mussel presence. We applied these criteria to the river's meso-scale hydromorphological unit mappings to identify suitable mesohabitats, which then served as a calibration data set for the coarser scale model. The final meso-scale model's predictions were hydraulically validated offering encouraging results. The meso-scale habitat suitability criteria defined moderately deep, slow-flowing, and non-turbulent hydromorphologic units as providing good conditions for A. heterodon. All three of the developed suitability models (descriptive statistics, CART and logistic regression model) indicated the species preference for hydraulically stable habitats.},

Through the support from a mesohabitat simulation model, we identified three habitat metrics: (1) Habitat Quantity Deficiency; (2) Alteration of Habitat Structure; and (3) Habitat Stress Days Alteration to quantify and visualize differences between restoration options in Restoration Alternatives Assessment diagram. This concept of quantifying habitat models is supported by an example of application in the Wekepeke Brook in Massachusetts, in which the habitat metrics were used to define quantitative benchmarks, goals and targets to guide the restoration process from the design to the evaluation phase.

The goal of this study was to identify strategies to protect and support the recovery of the dwarf wedgemussel populations in the mainstem Delaware River. We quantified potential habitat, developed instreamflow recovery scenarios and modelled the scenario outcomes. Mesohabitat simulation model and River2D have been used to allow the transfer of suitability criteria between scales. Habitat time series were investigated with the help of the uniform continuous under threshold technique to establish natural habitat stressor thresholds. Exceedance of persistent and catastrophic durations results in habitat stress days (HSD). HSD served as a metric for the comparison of four flow and two habitat management scenarios. The greatest habitat improvements were accomplished through increasing the boundary Reynolds number, hence increasing the river bed diversity. The introduction of naturalized flows into the model did not cause any significant reduction of HSD, demonstrating that optimizing suitable habitat for dwarf wedgemussel may not be achieved without including morphological improvements. Both minimum and pulsed flow augmentation strategies were found to nullify rare stress days in our models. Our study found that, at a minimum, a pulsed flow regime would need to be created to promote the development of populations beyond the current mussel beds. To accomplish protection and enhancement of habitat fully, channel improvements that reduce boundary Reynolds number appear necessary.

Therefore, most regional methods are based on observation of hydrological patterns and lack evidence of connection to biological responses. In contrast, biologically sound methods are too detailed and resource-consuming for applications on larger scales. The purpose of this pilot project was to develop an approach that would breach this gap and provide biologically sound rules for environmental flow (eflow) estimation for the region of Poland. The concept was developed using seven river sites, which represent the four of six fish-ecological freshwater body types common in Poland. Each of these types was distinguished based on a specific fish community structure, composed of habitat-use guilds. The environmental significance of the flows for these communities was established with help of the habitat simulation model MesoHABSIM computed for each of the seven sites. The established seasonal environmental flow thresholds were standardized to the watershed area and assigned to the corresponding water body type. With these obtained environmental flow coefficients, a standard-setting formula was created, which is compatible with existing standard-setting approaches while maintaining biological significance. The proposed approach is a first attempt to use habitat suitability models to justify a desktop formula for the regional scale eflow criteria.},

To predict the impact of climate change, metrics that allow the quantitative linking of physical disturbance attributes to the directions and intensities of biological impacts are needed. The link between habitat change and the character of biological response is provided by the frequency of occurrence of the river wave characteristic{\textemdash}that is the event's predictability.

Here, a Conceptual Habitat Alteration Model for Ponding is developed to aid in evaluating the effects of impoundments on fish habitats. Fish communities present in rivers with low human impact and their broad environmental settings enable classification of European rivers into 15 macrohabitat types. These classifications, together with the estimated fish sensitivity to alteration of their habitat are used for assessing the impacts of six main barrier types (dams, weirs, sluices, culverts, fords, and ramps). Our results indicate that over 200,000\,km or 10\% of previously free-flowing river habitat has been altered due to impoundments. Although they appear less frequently, dams, weirs and sluices cause much more habitat alteration than the other types. Their impact is regionally diverse, which is a function of barrier height, type and density, as well as biogeographical location. This work allows us to foresee what potential environmental gain or loss can be expected with planned barrier management actions in rivers, and to prioritize management actions.},

  abstract = {Channel roughness is the most sensitive parameter in development of hydraulic model for flood forecasting and flood plane mapping. Hence, in the present study it is attempted to calibrate the channel roughness coefficient (Manning's ``n'' value) along the river Mahanadi, Odisha through simulation of floods using HEC-RAS. For calibration of Manning's ``n'' value the flood of year 2003 has been considered. The calibrated model, in terms of channel roughness, has been used to simulate the flood for year 2006 in the same river reach. The performance of the calibrated and validated HEC-RAS based model is tested using Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency. It is concluded from the simulation study that Mannnig's ``n'' value of 0.032 gives best result for Khairmal to Munduli reach of Mahanadi River.},

This mobilization is due to the action of fluid forces on the exposed grains. Substrate particles can participate in the bedload only to the extent that local or global scour results in their exposure on the surface. It follows that a calculation of the bedload transport rate of mixtures should be based on the availability of each size range in the surface layer. Herein an existing empirical substrate-based bedload relation for gravel mixtures, developed solely with reference to field data, is transformed into a surface-based relation.}

  abstract = {The concept of equal mobility of gravel transport is 2 decades old. The weak form of the hypothesis states that in order to transport the coarse half of the mean annual gravel load through a river reach at a rate equal to the fine half, the coarser material must be overrepresented on the bed surface, giving rise to a mobile-bed armor. The degree of mobile-bed armoring necessary to accomplish this diminishes with increasing bed shear stress. The strong form of the hypothesis states that the grain size distribution of the gravel portion of the bed load should be similar to that of the substrate and finer than that of the surface layer. Here the hypothesis is subjected to a rigorous test in the laboratory under controlled conditions which are nevertheless chosen to be as representative as possible of actual field conditions. The grain size distributions used in the experiment included both model ``gravel'' and model ``sand.'' At the end of the experiment the entire surface layer and a significant depth of substrate were removed from an entire reach of the channel and sieved. The results of the experiment confirmed the weak form of equal mobility: The surface layer was significantly coarsened compared with the bed load, even when the ``sand'' was excluded from the size distributions. The strong form of equal mobility was also supported by the experiment, in that the size distribution of the ``gravel'' substrate was nearly identical to the size distribution of the ``gravel'' portion of the load. The gravel substrate was, however, slightly but measurably coarser than the gravel load, a tendency that has been observed in the field in cases for which the strong form is not satisfied.},

  abstract = {Given the importance of pressure gradients in driving secondary flow, it is worth studying how the modelled flow structures in a natural river bend can be impacted by the assumption of hydrodynamic pressure. In this paper, the performance of hydrostatic versus nonhydrostatic pressure assumption in the three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic modelling of a tortuously meandering river is studied. Both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic numerical models were developed using Delft3D-Flow to predict the 3D flow field in a reach of Stillwater Creek in Ottawa, Canada. An acoustic Doppler velocimeter was employed to measure the 3D flow field at a section in a sharp bend of the simulated river at two flow stages. The results of the Delft3D hydrostatic model agreed well with the acoustic Doppler velocimeter measurements: The hydrostatic model predicted reasonably accurately both the streamwise velocity distribution across the section and the magnitude and location of the primary secondary flow cell. The results of the Delft3D nonhydrostatic approximation showed that the model was not conservative and could not accurately generate either the secondary flow or the streamwise velocity distribution. This study illustrated the superior performance of the hydrostatic over nonhydrostatic 3D modelling of the secondary flow using Delft3D. Several possible reasons for unfavourable performance of the nonhydrostatic version of Delft3D are discussed, including the pressure correction technique employed in Delft3D. Considering the uncertainties that may arise in both modelling and field measurements, the 3D hydrostatic Delft3D model was capable of reasonably predicting the river bend flow structures in the studied meandering creek.},

  abstract = {This study used fully spatially distributed three-dimensional (3D) velocity data for the improved calibration of a 3D hydrodynamic model. The conventional calibration methods do not account for the spatial distribution of the fully 3D flow field. This study compared the results of the proposed calibration approach with those in the literature to show how choosing different calibration methods can change the model predictive capability. The proposed calibration approach can advance the model prediction of 3D flow complexity; consequently, it enhances the potential for the estimation of river processes such as channel morphodynamics and contaminant mixing. To test the proposed methodology, a tortuously natural meandering river was simulated using the Delft3D hydrodynamic model. The spatially intensive acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) velocity data collected throughout the river model domain provided the fully 3D distributed velocities for the model calibration. For the accurate and realistic comparison of the fully 3D predicted velocities and the measured velocities, an algorithm was developed to match the location of each ADCP bin with the 3D model grid points. The results of this study demonstrated that the fully 3D calibration method led to a calibrated model parameterization that was different from that obtained from conventional calibration approaches. The t-test analysis illustrated that with or without implementation of the horizontal large eddy simulation (HLES) model option, the model results were sensitive to the user input background horizontal eddy viscosity, confirming the importance of an appropriate calibration of the developed 3D model. The results of various calibration approaches were validated using the 3D velocity data collected at a bend section in the river using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV). It was shown that the proposed 3D calibration approach resulted in the best model performance. The results of this study suggest that the proposed methodology can provide a better calibration potential for the simulation of natural meandering rivers with complex geometry.

Its effectiveness and efficiency has rendered it a valuable metaheuristic approach in various scientific fields where complex optimization problems appear. Its simplicity has made it accessible to the non-expert researchers, while the potential for easy adaptation of operators and integration of new procedures allows its application on a wide variety of problems with diverse characteristics. Additionally, its inherent decentralized nature allows easy parallelization, taking advantage of modern high-performance computer systems. The present work exposes the basic concepts of particle swarm optimization and presents a number of popular variants that opened new research directions by introducing novel ideas in the original model of the algorithm. The focus is placed on presenting the essential information of the algorithms rather than covering all the details. Also, a large number of references and sources is provided for further inquiry. Thus, the present text can serve as a starting point for researchers interested in the development and application of particle swarm optimization and its variants.},

  abstract = {Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability or speed, but not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Analysis of upwelling radiation (spectral reflectance) by remote sensing may provide valuable information on the nature and distribution of the primary producers, the microphytobenthos, on intertidal mudflat systems. Spatial and temporal variation in the spectral reflectance signal (400-900 nm) from the surface of an exposed intertidal mudflat was investigated in relation to the density and vertical position of microphytobenthos assemblages within the sediment. Spatial measurements were obtained from areas of sediment colonized by different assemblages of microphytobenthos (mainly mixtures of diatoms and euglenids). In addition, a station was selected to examine temporal changes in spectral reflectance (corrected for variations in ambient light) over an exposure period. It was shown that the spectral reflectance signal varied, depending on the pigment compliment and biomass of the surface assemblages of microphytobenthos. The qualitative variation in composition of the assemblages visualized by low-temperature scanning electron microscopy was confirmed by analysis of species composition (light microscopy) and by pigment fingerprinting (diode array high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]). Time-series analysis showed that the migration of cells to the surface of the sediment during a daytime emersion period rapidly changed the optical properties of the sediment surface. Analysis of sediment pigment content was conducted using standard surface scrapes (0.5-cm depth) and a high resolution sectioning technique (200-mu m layers). The migration influence was only detected by fine-scale analysis of pigments. This was demonstrated by a step-wise elimination analysis, which showed that correlations between the absorbance characteristics of the sediment and pigment content improved as premigration data were excluded. Maximum light penetration into the natural sediment was of the order of 2 mm under light conditions comparable with ambient levels. Two main conclusions were drawn from this study: (1) interpretation of spectral reflectance data must be consistent with knowledge of the ecology and behavior (cyclic migration patterns) of intertidal microphytobenthos, and (2) ground truthing of pigment-related signals from intertidal Bats should be conducted on a scale relevant to the process of spectral reflectance from sediments. The implications of these findings are discussed.}

The proposed equations take adequate care of the interaction affect. Results from the formulations, simulating the three-dimensional velocity field in the main channel and in the floodplain of meandering compound channels are compared with their respective experimental channel data obtained from a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical test channels with smooth and rough sections. The aspect ratio of the test channels varies from two to five. The equations are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data.

  abstract = {Sedimentation has a prominent impact on the functionality and lifetime of reservoirs and is a growing concern for stakeholders. Various parameters influence sedimentation caused by soil erosion. Here we have examined fifty Italian reservoirs to determine sedimentation rates and storage capacity loss. The reservoirs studied have an average age of 78 years as of 2021, with the highest loss of capacity observed, equal to 100\%, for Ceppo Morelli. For the fifty Italian catchments covering north, south, central and islands of Italy, we found the mean annual sediment yield varying between 17{\textendash}4000~m3/km2. year. Six of fifty reservoirs studied (Quarto, Colombara, Ceppo Morelli, Fusino, Vodo and Valle di Cadore) are already in a very critical situation in terms of storage capacity loss. Out of the fifty reservoirs, half of them will reach their half-life year by 2050. For example, for the Fusino reservoir located in northern Italy, we observed a loss of 90\% of the storage volume as of 2020 with respect to its operation year 1974, compared to 6\% in 2015 as available in literature. Modelling the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) is an open question, due to the lack of adequate data and uncertainties about the variability in hydrological, geomorphological, climate and landcover parameters. Here, we addressed the issue with a simplified multiple regression approach based on sediment delivery ratio values retrieved by the RUSLE model. We found different multi regressions for reservoirs belonging to the Alpine and Apennine regions. This analysis offers a starting point for the management and prioritization of adaptation and remediation policies necessary to address reservoir sedimentation.},

The major application of sensitivity analysis is to indicate the uncertainties in the input parameters of the model, which affects the model performance. There are different optimization algorithms developed and applied in the hydrologic model, which can be performed with different objective functions to calibrate and quantify the uncertainties in the system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the model calibration performance and sensitivity of parameters using three optimization algorithms and five objective functions for predicting monthly streamflow. Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2), Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE), and Parameter Solution (ParaSol) were used to calibrate the monthly streamflow for the semi-arid San Joaquin Watershed in California by using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The best performance metrics (R2, NSE, PBIAS, P-factor, and R-factor) were obtained by SUFI-2 while using NSE as the objective function. The coefficient of determination (R2), Nash{\textendash}Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), the percentage of bias (PBIAS), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) and Ratio of the standard deviation of observations to root mean square error (RSR) were used as an objective function to assess the monthly calibration performance. KGE was found to be a suitable objective function to calibrate this complex and snowmelt-dominated watershed. The findings from this study will serve as a guideline for hydro-ecological researchers to achieve further watershed management goals.},

The focus of past research has been with making the PSO method more complex, as this is frequently believed to increase its adaptability to other optimization problems. This study takes the opposite approach and simplifies the PSO method. To compare the efficacy of the original PSO and the simplified variant here, an easy technique is presented for efficiently tuning their behavioural parameters. The technique works by employing an overlaid meta-optimizer, which is capable of simultaneously tuning parameters with regard to multiple optimization problems, whereas previous approaches to meta-optimization have tuned behavioural parameters to work well on just a single optimization problem. It is then found that the PSO method and its simplified variant not only have comparable performance for optimizing a number of Artificial Neural Network problems, but the simplified variant appears to offer a small improvement in some cases.},

  abstract = {Restoring in-stream spawning habitats in degraded rivers has received increasing attention as a tool for mitigating local wild fish population declines, notably in response to the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). However, spawning gravel placements are far too often designed without accurate knowledge of the morphodynamic river processes, resulting in a limited efficacy and longevity of the artificial spawning ground. To address the combined effects of bedload transport and fine sediment clogging processes on the sustainability of artificial spawning gravel habitats, we examined the effects of such rehabilitation actions on six degraded river reaches in Wallonia, Belgium. The monitoring scheme was based on the evolution of the thickness and clogging of the spawning gravel (using wooden stakes driven into the gravel layer to measure the depth of the anoxia) and on the PIT-tagged tracking of gravel dispersion over a period of 3.6{\textendash}8.5 yrs. On the one hand, the results highlighted that several artificial spawning grounds were quickly clogged because of improper sizing of the spawning material. Gravel that was too coarse to be mobilized by the river and that had a narrow grain size range favoured fine sediment accumulation within the interstices of the gravel layer. On the other hand, one spawning gravel placement was rapidly scoured (after 2.2 yrs) because of an undersizing of the gravel with respect to flow competence. In the end, one gravel placement presented adequate gravel sizing, allowing periodic gravel transport over short distances (the mean annual travel distance was {\textasciitilde}3~m). The longevity of a gravel placement and the ability of the displaced gravel to form new spawning grounds downstream were strongly dependent on the distance that the placed gravel was likely to travel, which in turn depended on several hydromorphological parameters, such as unit stream power, channel morphology and bed texture. The key parameters highlighted in this study need to be acknowledged when designing spawning gravel placement projects.},

It was found that sediment deposited as melt out sediment from ice floes may account for a major part of the net accumulation on the fringing salt marshes, and it is suggested that sediment in the intertidal is transported from the lower part of the mudflat towards the higher lying parts thus influencing both the micro relief and the slope of the mudflat significantly. The transport distance was estimated to be at least in the order of 2 km, and the transport from the intertidal onto the salt marsh was found to be a one way transport process because vegetation quite rapidly grows through the melt out sediment, thus preventing resuspension. The results suggest that the ice transport process can be defined as a secondary process because it almost exclusively redistributes sediment already imported to the estuary. This is contrasting the primary estuarine processes of settling{\textendash}scour-lag, tidal pumping and estuarine circulation which continuously concentrate cohesive sediment in the estuarine waters.},

The characteristic frequency, the longitudinal wave length and the mean lateral extension of the meandering jet were extracted from the first paired modes, obtained by a proper orthogonal decomposition of the surface velocity field measured by large scale PIV. The depth-normalised characteristic lengths and the Strouhal number were then compared to the main dimensionless numbers characterizing the experiments: Froude number, friction number and reservoir shape factor. The normalised wave length and mean lateral extension of the meandering jet are neither correlated with the Froude number nor with the reservoir shape factor; but a clear relationship is found with the friction number. Similarly, the Strouhal number is found proportional to a negative power of the friction number. In contrast, the Froude number and the reservoir shape factor enable to predict the occurrence of a meandering flow pattern: meandering jets occur for Froude number greater than 0.21 and for a shape factor smaller than 6.2.},

  abstract = {The effect of the shallowness on meandering jets in a shallow rectangular reservoir is investigated. Four meandering flows were investigated in an experimental shallow rectangular reservoir. Their boundary conditions were chosen to cover a large range of friction numbers (defined with the sudden expansion width). Due to the unsteady characteristics of the flows, a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the fluctuating part of the surface velocity fields measured using Large-Scale Particle Image Velocity was used for discriminating the flow structures responsible for the meandering of the jet. Less than 1 \% of the calculated POD modes significantly contribute to the meandering of the jet, and two types of instability are in competition in such a flow configuration. The sinuous mode is the dominant mode in the flow, and it induces the meandering of the flow, while the varicose mode is a source of local mixing and weakly participates to the flow. The fluctuating velocity fields were then reconstructed using the POD modes corresponding to 80 \% of the total mean fluctuating kinetic energy, and the coherent structures were identified using the residual vorticity, their centres being localised using a topology algorithm. The trajectories of the structures centres emphasise that at high friction number the coherent structures are small and laterally paired in the near, middle and far fields of the jet, while with decreasing friction number, the structures merge into large horizontal vortices in the far field of the jet, their trajectories showing more variability in space and time.},

Four meandering flows of various shallowness were modeled using an academic flow model that includes a depthaveraged k-{$\epsilon$} model accounting for the horizontal and vertical turbulent length-scales. Different roughness heights were considered for modeling the bottom friction. A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) was applied to the simulation results to extract the behavior of the main structures responsible for the meandering flow. The same POD analysis was also performed for the reference experimental flow fields, obtained by large-scale particle image velocimetry. The first two POD modes obtained from the numerical simulations assuming a smooth bottom are in good agreement with the experimental modes in terms of energy, as well as temporal and spatial variations, whatever the shallowness. In contrast, the remaining simulated modes are not well rendered. The effect of an increased roughness height in the simulations is finally discussed. It leads to an improved reproduction of the first two modes and of the following modes, except when significant viscous effects govern in the flow.

In this paper, we propose a new memetic computing model, using a hierarchical particle swarm optimizer (HPSO) and latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method. In the bottom layer of hierarchical PSO, several swarms evolve in parallel to avoid being trapped in local optima. The learning strategy for each swarm is the well-known comprehensive learning method with a newly designed mutation operator. After the evolution process accomplished in bottom layer, one particle for each swarm is selected as candidate to construct the swarm in the top layer, which evolves by the same strategy employed in the bottom layer. The local search strategy based on LHS is imposed on particles in the top layer every specified number of generations. The new memetic computing model is extensively evaluated on a suite of 16 numerical optimization functions as well as the cylindricity error evaluation problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm compares favorably with conventional PSO and several variants.},

  abstract = {In alpine catchments, fluctuations of river discharge occur at multiple temporal scales due to natural (e.g., snow and glacier melt) and anthropogenic factors (e.g., reservoir and hydropower operation). In the last century, several modifications of the natural flow regime have been observed, originating in the complex interplay between construction of dams for hydropower production, changes in water management policies and climate. In this work, we show that multiresolution analysis via discrete wavelet transform and continuous wavelet transform allow identifying both old breakpoints caused by dam and hydropower plant construction as well as more recent breakpoints caused by changes in hydropower plant operation. According to the detected breakpoints we can differentiate a pre-impact period (natural flow regime), post-impact period (characterized by river damming and hydropower facilities operation) and a last period after the recent detected breakpoints (caused by changes in water management). Moreover, by analyzing streamflow time series and their log transform it is possible to highlight low flow alterations and distinguish the causes of the breakpoints, since they affect different temporal scales. The change point analysis is performed using different mother wavelets: Haar, Daubechies 2 (db2), and Daubechies 20 (db20). Considering the results obtained with the Haar mother wavelet: a total of 14 historical breakpoints in 13 streamflow time series belonging to the Adige and Inn catchments were identified and 93\% correspond to metadata associated to river damming and hydropower production; a total of 5 recent breakpoints were identified, which correspond to metadata associated to river damming and hydropower production. In case of the log transform of the streamflow: 32 historical breakpoints were identified and 100\% confirmed by metadata; 20 recent breakpoints were detected and 83\% correspond to metadata. The uncertainty in the temporal location is investigated computing the mean difference between detected breakpoint temporal location and metadata and is generally smaller than 1\,year. This work shows that change point analysis performed using wavelet transform allows us to differentiate and correctly locate in time most of change points in streamflow variability that can be associated to river damming and hydropower production.},

Conventional and low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (SEM and LTSEM, respectively) have often been used to visualise biofilms and microbial mats and investigate their role in the biogenic stabilisation of sediments. This study investigated the use of LTSEM to image the "binding" of artificial sand and clay systems by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Xanthurn gum (commercial bacterial EPS) and diatom EPS were mixed with cleaned sand particles and the apparent structure of the polymer in the matrix observed in relation to different stages of sample preparation. In addition, diatoms were added to sand to allow comparison of EPS production "in situ" within the matrix, with that prepared separately and added. The commonly accepted in situ structure of polymer, strands and plates, was found to be a preparatory artefact, as a result of desiccation of the sample prior to freezing, cryofixation and also partial freeze-drying in the LTSEM. The natural structure of the polymer is more likely to be an amorphous gel/sol equilibrium within the inter-particle spaces. In addition, EPS produced by diatoms in situ and examined by LTSEM forms a granular "floc and plate" structure, similar in appearance to fine cohesive particles, rather than the strands and plates previously reported. These results show that caution is needed where a mechanistic interpretation of polymer binding is derived from interpreting LTSEM images. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in monitoring technology have enabled high frequency, in-situ measurements of total phosphorus and total reactive phosphorus to be undertaken with high precision, whilst turbidity can provide an excellent surrogate for suspended sediment. Despite these measurements being fundamental to understanding the mechanisms and flow paths that deliver these constituents to river networks, there is a paucity of such data for headwater agricultural catchments. The aim of this paper is to deduce the dominant mechanisms for the delivery of fine sediment and phosphorus to an upland river network in the UK through characterisation of the temporal variability of hydrological fluxes, and associated soluble and particulate concentrations for the period spanning March 2012{\textendash}February 2013. An assessment of the factors producing constituent hysteresis is undertaken following factor analysis (FA) on a suite of measured environmental variables representing the fluvial and wider catchment conditions prior to, and during catchment-wide hydrological events. Analysis indicates that suspended sediment is delivered to the fluvial system predominantly via rapidly responding pathways driven by event hydrology. However, evidence of complex, figure-of-eight hysteresis is observed following periods of hydrological quiescence, highlighting the importance of preparatory processes. Sediment delivery via a slow moving, probably sub-surface pathway does occur, albeit infrequently and during low magnitude events at the catchment outlet. Phosphorus is revealed to have a distinct hysteretic response to that of suspended sediment, with sub-surface pathways dominating. However, high magnitude events were observed to exhibit threshold-like behaviour, whereby activation and connection of usually disconnected depositional zones to the fluvial networks results in the movement of vast phosphorus fluxes. Multiple pathways are observed for particulate and soluble constituents, highlighting the challenges faced in mitigating the delivery of contaminant fluxes to headwater river systems.},

  abstract = {A reliable estimation of sediment transport in gravel-bed streams is important for various practical engineering and biological studies (e.g., channel stability design, bed degradation/aggradation, restoration of spawning habitat). In the present work, we report original laboratory experiments investigating the transport of gravel particles at low bed shear stresses. The laboratory tests were conducted under unsteady flow conditions inducing low bed shear stresses, with detailed monitoring of the bed topography using a laser scanner. Effects of bed surface arrangements were documented by testing loose and packed bed configurations. Effects of fine sediments were examined by testing beds with sand, artificial fine sand or cohesive silt infiltrated in the gravel matrix. Analysis of the experimental data revealed that the transport of gravel particles depends upon the bed arrangement, the bed material properties (e.g., size and shape, consolidation index, permeability) and the concentration of fine sediments within the surface layer of moving grains. This concentration is directly related to the distribution of fine particles within the gravel matrix (i.e., bottom-up infiltration or bridging) and their transport mode (i.e., bedload or suspended load). Compared to loose beds, the mobility of gravel is reduced for packed beds and for beds clogged from the bottom up with cohesive fine sediments; in both cases, the bed shear stress for gravel entrainment increases by about 12\%. On the other hand, the mobility of gravel increases significantly (bed shear stress for particle motion decreasing up to 40\%) for beds clogged at the surface by non-cohesive sand particles.

  abstract = {\&lt;p\&gt;The need for effective water resources management has turned into a major challenge, especially in the face of climate change. Meteorological data is not always readily available and thus the task of predicting the response of hydrological systems becomes complicated. For this reason, climate reanalysis datasets are used as a viable alternative. They combine models with data from satellites and ground sensors and provide consistent long-term meteorological conditions with high temporal resolution. The ERA5 reanalysis dataset was produced and is continuously updated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Within this framework, the ERA5 reanalysis dataset has been applied to predict the hydrological response of the Devoll River catchment in Albania. Due to its location, Albania belongs to the Mediterranean climatic belt, which is characterized by hot dry summers and mild rainy winters. The Devoll River catchment is situated south from the capital city Tirana and covers a surface of around 3140 km\&lt;sup\&gt;2\&lt;/sup\&gt;. The flow regime of this catchment consists mainly of snowmelt in the upstream mountainous part, whereas precipitation dominates the lower regions. The simulation of the different flow components was carried out with the latest version of the Water Balance and Simulation Model (WaSiM) on a daily time step. The performance of the simulation was evaluated with the Nash-Sutcliffe (NSE) and the Kling-Gupta (KGE) efficiencies, yielding values of 0.66 and 0.80, respectively. Although the model performance suggests some deficiencies, it is considered satisfactory given that ERA5 is a reanalysis dataset with modelled precipitation fields. From the resulting hydrographs, it is possible to infer that observed and simulated runoff follow the same dynamics and a close correspondence between flow peaks can be achieved. These results finally reinforce the idea of applying ERA5 datasets in cases where meteorological input data availability is low or even absent.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

  abstract = {Achieving a sustainable management of sediment fluxes in existing or proposed reservoirs is a challenging but essential requirement for dam operators. Such objective is of utmost importance to avoid sedimentation-related consequences. Numerical modelling is of great interest to understand the flow and sediment dynamics in a reservoir, to simulate the long-term evolution of sediment deposits and to evaluate the efficiency of various management strategies. This paper presents recent case studies, which validate the feasibility and relevancy of such technical option. The progresses obtained on essential stages of the numerical modelling of sediments dynamics in reservoirs are particularly emphasized. Concerning the distribution of deposits, a promising field method based on an optimum combination of direct samplings with acoustic measurements and video auscultations is detailed. Feedbacks are then provided concerning an innovative device deployed in the field for a direct measurement of the settling velocity. Issues about the assessment of calibration parameters are also addressed in this communication. Lab experiments performed on deposits sampled in several reservoirs provide practical guidance to evaluate the erosion parameters of sediments. Finally, several examples of sediment dynamics modelling in reservoirs including both cohesive and non-cohesive sediment are presented.}

  abstract = {The channel-bed materials have a marked influence on the biota of lotic systems. Experimental studies suggest that flow regulation, specificially the reduction in magnitude of flood events, may lead to the infiltration of fine particles into, and the concentration of these sediments within, open framework gravels downstream from tributary sediment sources. This paper examines the distribution of fines (sub-2 mm), within channel substrate gravels along two regulated rivers in upland Britain. Bulk- and freeze-sample techniques were used: the latter yielded volumes of fines five times those of the former. This emphasizes the problem of wash-out during bulk-sample collection, especially in compact, coarse gravel substrates. Nevertheless, the same spatial pattern was revealed by both data sets. Along both regulated rivers, the proportion of the substrate finer than 2 mm exceeds 20 per cent, by weight, below tributary confluences, contrasting with values for non-regulated sites of less than 5 per cent. Both the amount and size of matrix sediments decrease downstream from the confluences. The spatial scale of the impact is small and the resultant ecological consequences of substrate sedimentation are likely to be localized.},

  abstract = {This paper identifies the principal regulated rivers in Britain and summarizes their physical and ecological characteristics. Virtually all major rivers in the United Kingdom are shown to be regulated directly or indirectly by mainstream impoundments, interbasin transfers, pumped storage reservoirs, or groundwater abstractions. Flow records for sixty per cent of all gauging stations are significantly affected by flow manipulations. Three phases in the development of river regulation are identified: firstly, the development of direct supply and compensation reservoirs from 1840; secondly, the development of large dams and large-scale interbasin water transfers from 1890; and thirdly, the modern era of multipurpose river regulation that began in 1965. Any assessment of the environmental effects of river regulation must consider the spatial variation of natural river systems throughout the U.K., climatic changes, and the cumulative effect of river regulation and other impacts over an historic timescale. Today, the rivers of the U.K. are shown to have an underlying character that reflects the marked climatic, geologic, and topographic differences between the upland north and west, and lowland south and east; differences in part that relate to their different histories during the Pleistocene. However, many rivers show the effects of human impacts that began about 5000 years ago. Most rivers have experienced changes since about 1930 consequent upon afforestaton, land drainage, and channelization. These, together with short-term climatic changes, make defining ecological impacts of river regulation problematic. Pollution has had the most dramatic effects. Nevertheless, it is suggested that new concepts of environmentally sound river regulation could lead to the restoration and even enhancement of rivers in the United Kingdom.},

This paper reviews the advances of this environmental flows science over the past 30 years since the introduction of the Instream Flow Incremental Methodology. Its central component, Physical HABitat SIMulation, has had a global impact, internationalizing the e-flows agenda and promoting new science. A global imperative to set e-flows, including an emerging trend to set standards at the regional scale, has led to developments of hydrological and hydraulic approaches but expert judgment remains a critical element of the complex decision-making process around water allocations. It is widely accepted that river ecosystems are dependent upon the natural variability of flow (the flow regime) that is typical of each hydro-climatic region and upon the range of habitats found within each channel type within each region. But as the sophistication of physical (hydrological and hydraulic) models has advanced emerging biological evidence to support those assumptions has been limited. Empirical studies have been important to validate instream flow recommendations but they have not generated transferable relationships because of the complex nature of biological responses to hydrological change that must be evaluated over decadal time-scales. New models are needed to incorporate our evolving knowledge of climate cycles and morphological sequences of channel development but most importantly we need long-term research involving both physical scientists and biologists to develop new models of population dynamics that will advance the biological basis for 21st Century e-flow science.},

  abstract = {The digestion of biogenic organic matter is an essential step of sample preparation within microplastic analyses. Organic residues hamper the separation of polymer particles especially within density separation or polymer identification via spectroscopic and staining methods. Therefore, a concise literature survey has been undertaken to identify the most commonly applied digestion protocols with a special focus on water and sediments samples. The selected protocols comprise different solutions, concentrations, and reaction temperatures. Within this study we tested acids (nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), bases (sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide), and oxidizing agents [hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite and Fenton's reagent (hydrogen peroxide 30\% in combination with iron(II)sulfate 0.27\%)] at different concentrations, temperature levels, and reaction times on their efficiency of biogenic organic matter destruction and the resistance of different synthetic polymers against the applied digestion protocols. Tests were carried out in three parallels on organic material (soft tissue{\textemdash}leaves, hard tissue{\textemdash}branches, and calcareous material{\textemdash}shells) and six polymers (low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate) in two size categories. Before and after the application of different digestion protocols, the material was weighed in order to determine the degree of digestion efficiency and polymer resistance, respectively. The efficiency of organic matter destruction is highly variable. Calcareous shells showed no to very low reaction to oxidizing agents and bases, but were efficiently dissolved with both tested acids at all concentrations and at all temperatures. Soft and hard tissue were most efficiently destroyed by sodium hypochlorite. However, the other reagents can also have good effects, especially by increasing the temperature to 40{\textendash}50{\textdegree}C. The additional temperature increase to 60{\textendash}70{\textdegree}C showed a further but less effective improvement, compared to the initial temperature increase. The resistance of tested polymer types can be rated as good except for polyamide and polyethylene terephthalate. Increasing the concentrations and temperatures, however, results in accelerated degradation of all polymers. This is most evident for polyamide and polyethylene terephthalate, which show losses in weight between 15 and 100\% when the digestion temperature is increased. This effect is most pronounced for polyamide in the presence of acids and for polyethylene terephthalate digested with bases. As a concluding recommendation the selection of the appropriate digestion method should be specifically tested within initial pre-tests to account for the specific composition of the sample matrix and the project objectives.},

Individual particles obey Langevin equations which are switched on and off by particle entrainment and deposition. The flux is calculated as the rate of many such particles crossing a control surface within a specified observation time. Flux distributions inherit observation-time dependence from the on-off motions of particles. At the longest observation times, distributions converge to sharp peaks around classically-expected values, but at short times, fluctuations are erratic. We relate this scale dependence of bedload transport rates to the movement characteristics of individual grains.

Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration Pathways are extended at temporal and spatial scales relevant for the most contributing sectors. Extended socioeconomic and climate scenarios are then used as inputs for spatially and temporally detailed models for population and land use change, and their subsequent impact on nutrient loading is computed. According to the model simulations, several factors of varying influence may either increase or decrease total nutrient loads. In general, societal drivers outweigh the impacts of changing climate. Food demand is the most impactful driver, strongly affecting land use and nutrient loads from agricultural lands in the long run. In order to reach the good environmental status of the Baltic Sea, additional nutrient abatement efforts should focus on phosphorus rather than nitrogen. Agriculture is the most important sector to be addressed under the conditions of gradually increasing precipitation in the region and increasing global demand for food.},

In other words, the performance of some modified genotypes was investigated in terms of improvement of crop yield which is the most important parameter of crop growth and development. The superior mutated line (SML) by nuclear method (gamma irradiation) was selected by carrying out several greenhouse and field experiments for 13~years (2001{\textendash}2013). Consequently, growth and development properties were recorded to calibrate and validate the crop model. Moreover, the MarkSim weather generator was used for downscaling daily weather data (maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, and radiation) for the period 2021{\textendash}2030 under three scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. Field findings showed that the yield of SML is around 26\% more than the parent line. The DSSAT model could simulate this yield increment with RMSE below 7\%. Under climate change conditions, the SML yield level was 20{\textendash}25\% higher than that of the parent line suggesting that the SML is more resistant than the parent line to plausible climate change impacts. Nevertheless, adopting policies to decrease water use reduces yield levels of both lines. It confirmed that low-irrigation condition, as an inevitable issue, overcomes possible positive impacts reported by many researchers. Hence, associated water stress should be controlled by cultivating more resilient cultivars. This study recommends cropping the SML line in soybean croplands to sustain crop yield.},

This article discusses the differences in habitat suitability assessment between 2D and 3D CFD modelling as input for the habitat simulation tool CASiMiR. In the first part of the article, the accuracy of the hydraulic model is evaluated by comparing the model results with laboratory (model of a laboratory channel with erodible bed) and field measurements (Valsura River, Bolzano, Italy). In the second part, the habitat suitability for the Valsura River case study (affected by hydropeaking), is analyzed comparing different approaches for the reconstruction of the velocity field (depth-averaged velocities from 2D modelling, bottom velocity field reconstruction with log-law approach from 2D modelling and bottom velocity field from 3D modelling). The results show that the habitat suitability index (HSI) using 2D or 3D hydrodynamic models can be significantly different. These differences can be ascribed to a higher capability to depict the features of the flow field with highly variable and heterogeneous boundary conditions and to the possibility to simulate the near bed hydrodynamic parameters, which are relevant for certain target species. In particular, the HSI-values using 3D hydraulics lead to larger areas of highly suitable habitats compared to 2D simulations. Moreover, considering the entire flow range of hydropeaking events, the habitat simulations with bottom flow velocities from 3D modelling provide suitable habitats over the entire flow range representing the availability of stable suitable habitats, while the habitat availability of 2D modelled flow velocity is continuously decreasing with increasing flow rates.},

  abstract = {Steep gravel-bed rivers sometimes experience floods that dramatically rework river bed structure and topography. Hazard assessments and paleo-event reconstructions require better knowledge of such phenomena. This paper explores morphodynamic evolution of steep channels carrying bedload-laden flows, using a generic Froude-scaled model. Bedload-laden floods were introduced in a narrow flume and spread into a 5 times wider unconfined area with a 0.1 steep slope (m/m). Image analysis enabled measurements taken at an unprecedented level of accuracy on unconfined flows laden with bedload. A flow reconstruction procedure was used to compute depth, Froude (Fr) and Shields ({$\tau$}*) numbers on millions of pixels based on a friction law and measurements of surface velocity, slope, and roughness. Despite the steep slope, Froude numbers proved to be mostly subcritical in all but the regions experiencing the most active sediment transport. Competent flows, identified by the transport stage higher than unity ( ), were near critical and seldom had Fr{$>$} 1.3{\textendash}1.5. This demonstrates that, providing that bed width and structure can adjust, hydraulic features such as standing waves, hydraulic jumps, and lateral shock waves dissipate energy very efficiently in addition to adjusting channel features. These competent flows also tend to rework channels to approach the energy minimum of near-critical flows. This hypothesis was postulated by Gordon Grant (1997, https://doi.org/10.1029/96WR03134, Wat. Resour. Res. 33(2):349-358) but demonstrated here for the first time at this scale. Considering near-critical flows during discharges high enough to be clearly competent in laterally unconfined reaches seems reasonable as a first approximation in steep channels.},

  abstract = {Large boulders can jam in constrictions, both in canyons) and man-made structures (e.g. slit-dams). Boulder jamming occurs stochastically, and partially governs the outflow rate of debris flow material. Explicit hydro-mechanical models of boulder-laden flows are too computationally demanding to study this stochasticity. This study presents a new framework implemented into a numerical program. This program encapsulates basic hydraulic equations and criteria predicting boulder blockage at narrow sections, along with a simple statistical way to compute boulder sizes and numbers. The program applies empirical estimates by experts of the average number of boulders in a deposit to evaluate how equivalent multi-phase flows would interact with a constriction. The model stochastically generate boulders that can obstruct the constriction(s). The program outputs simple descriptions of the upstream flow level over time, as well as the downstream outlet discharge rate and volume. The model is fast (5{\textendash}30 s per run), allowing uncertainty propagation analyses of interactions between flows, boulders and constrictions. Interaction between both low- and high-risk flows can be quickly evaluated for different scenarios. For uncertainty propagation, we use possibility theory, which accommodates uncertainties relevant to debris flows. The framework gives practitioners a much-needed generalized approach for understanding the long-term behavior of boulder-laden flows through canyons, or for designing engineered structures. Finally, we apply the model to a field case {\textendash} the design of a proposed North American slit-dam {\textendash} thence elucidating the design requirements for effective flow control. We found that horizontal bars are necessary for dependably controlling outflow from this structure.},

Here, a laboratory study is conducted to investigate whether wood logs or trunks can be used for sediment management. The effectivity of a traditional vane field is compared to set-ups with screens of stacked logs, and large individual trunks. Results indicate that all three set-ups redistribute sediment but that the trunks are least effective in inducing a secondary circulation and cause higher turbulence and drag, leading to a stronger decrease in streamwise velocity. We conclude that a field of trunks acts as a sediment trap because of a strong reduction of the streamwise velocity, without a strong secondary flow such as dominant in the other configurations. Screens of stacked logs can be successfully implemented in rivers, as they are only slightly less effective than traditional vanes. The risk of piping underneath objects and the associated scour are points of concern.},

  abstract = {1. Relatively undisturbed streams in continental U.S.A. were classified according to variation in ten ecologically relevant hydrological characteristics. Measures of flow variability and predictability for average conditions, as well as for low- and high-flow extremes, were extracted from long-term (15{\textendash}58-year) daily streamflow data for 806 streams. 2. Two groups of sites were analysed: all 806 sites and a subset of 420 `best' sites. For each group, cluster analysis identified ten distinctive stream types, seven permanent and three intermittent. The geographical clustering exhibited by the stream types indicated regional differences in climatic and geological features. A bootstrapping technique applied to the permanent stream classes showed the majority of them were statistically robust. 3. The derived classification of U.S. streams based on ecologically relevant hydrological characteristics provides a comprehensive catalogue of small to mid-size streams that, according to ecological theory, may differ in major aspects of their ecological organization. The classification provides a basis for hypothesis generation and affords an objective framework for matching streams for purposes of comparative ecological investigations. 4. A subset of 118 streams from the ten classification groups was selected to determine whether certain hydrological variables often used by ecologists to make cross-system comparisons are sensitive to the temporal coarseness of the hydrological time series used to derive the variables. The three hydrological variables considered were streamflow predictability, streamflow variability and flood timing. 5. Streamflow predictability (using Colwell's Index) was calculated at daily, weekly, monthly and seasonal time scales. Estimates of predictability showed either no change across time scales, a gradual and consistent increase across time scales, or a maximum value at the monthly time scale. Coefficient of variation of streamflow was calculated at daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, and annual time steps. Daily values were always greatest for all streams. Some groups showed minimum variability at the monthly scale, others at the seasonal. Timing of daily peak flows could be detected with 50{\textendash}90\% accuracy across stream groups using coarser grain monthly and annual hydrographic data. 6. Inferences about hydrological similarity among streams across broad geographical scales can be sensitive to choice of time scale used in the hydrological characterization.},

  abstract = {1. In an effort to develop quantitative relationships between various kinds of flow alteration and ecological responses, we reviewed 165 papers published over the last four decades, with a focus on more recent papers. Our aim was to determine if general relationships could be drawn from disparate case studies in the literature that might inform environmental flows science and management. 2. For all 165 papers we characterised flow alteration in terms of magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and rate of change as reported by the individual studies. Ecological responses were characterised according to taxonomic identity (macroinvertebrates, fish, riparian vegetation) and type of response (abundance, diversity, demographic parameters). A `qualitative' or narrative summary of the reported results strongly corroborated previous, less comprehensive, reviews by documenting strong and variable ecological responses to all types of flow alteration. Of the 165 papers, 152 (92\%) reported decreased values for recorded ecological metrics in response to a variety of types of flow alteration, whereas 21 papers (13\%) reported increased values. 3. Fifty-five papers had information suitable for quantitative analysis of ecological response to flow alteration. Seventy per cent of these papers reported on alteration in flow magnitude, yielding a total of 65 data points suitable for analysis. The quantitative analysis provided some insight into the relative sensitivities of different ecological groups to alteration in flow magnitudes, but robust statistical relationships were not supported. Macroinvertebrates showed mixed responses to changes in flow magnitude, with abundance and diversity both increasing and decreasing in response to elevated flows and to reduced flows. Fish abundance, diversity and demographic rates consistently declined in response to both elevated and reduced flow magnitude. Riparian vegetation metrics both increased and decreased in response to reduced peak flows, with increases reflecting mostly enhanced non-woody vegetative cover or encroachment into the stream channel. 4. Our analyses do not support the use of the existing global literature to develop general, transferable quantitative relationships between flow alteration and ecological response; however, they do support the inference that flow alteration is associated with ecological change and that the risk of ecological change increases with increasing magnitude of flow alteration. 5. New sampling programs and analyses that target sites across well-defined gradients of flow alteration are needed to quantify ecological response and develop robust and general flow alteration{\textendash}ecological response relationships. Similarly, the collection of pre- and post-alteration data for new water development programs would significantly add to our basic understanding of ecological responses to flow alteration.},

  abstract = {Environmental flows assessment science focuses largely on defining how modified flow regimes (from water infrastructure and direct water abstraction) can be managed to conserve or restore societally desired ecological conditions in rivers and other wetland systems. The foundations of the science are based on hydroecological understanding and knowledge derived from empirical observation, indigenous (stakeholder) knowledge, and modeling. Flow-ecology relationships are the accepted basis of modern environmental water recommendations, and holistic (ecosystem) approaches have evolved as the main sphere of innovation over the last 40 years. Environmental water applications are increasing in sophistication from the desktop planning level through to advanced river basin and broader landscape water management. New regions are engaging with the environmental water enterprise and advancing the science, increasing rigor, implementation, and policy uptake. This challenging scientific and policy platform faces new challenges to integrate other partially or nonflow-related environmental factors that can limit the ecological outcomes of purely hydrologic restoration. Chief among these are sediment regime alteration, thermal regime alteration, and channel hydraulic features in re-regulated reaches. In addition, rapid human population growth, shifting ecological conditions ("baselines"), and climate change create new challenges for environmental water. The discipline must therefore transition from a historically focused, restore-to-reference perspective to one that aims for adaptation in the face of hydrologic and ecological change and increasing uncertainty. Less reliance on statistical flow-ecology relationships and more emphasis on process understanding of hydrologic controls on ecological dynamics will become increasingly important. Further, the local-scale focus of environmental water science will need to expand to a larger, basin-scale perspective that considers habitat connectivity and species movements that are critical components in attaining freshwater conservation. In summary, we provide seven guiding elements that will likely promote the successful advancement of environmental water science and implementation in the coming years. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Recently amended European (EU) water policies call for an adequate monitoring of the chemical status of sediments and suspended matter (SM) in rivers. In this study, we focus on long-term time series of particle-bound hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and selected polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB-138 and PCB-153) that were monitored biweekly to monthly at eight stations in the River Rhine catchment. Our aims are (1) to detect trends in the concentration series HCB, PCB-138 and PCB-153, (2) to estimate the uncertainty of loads caused by SM collection techniques and load calculation procedures and (3) to detect trends in the subsequently calculated annual load series. HCB concentration in the SM for the period 1995{\textendash}2008 significantly (p {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}01) decreased at six of the eight monitoring stations. Decreasing PCB-138 and PCB-153 concentrations are significant at six of the eight and seven of the eight monitoring stations, respectively. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) that tested the effect of two collection techniques and four load calculation procedures on annual loads indicates homogeneity of the methods at four of the five monitoring stations. At Weil, only the loads of HCB, PCB-138 and PCB-153 are significantly affected by the collection technique. The trend analysis of an extended series (1985{\textendash}2007) of annual HCB loads at Koblenz showed a significant decrease from about 110 kg year-1 to about 15{\textendash}23 kg year-1; however, in the shorter period (1995{\textendash}2007) only at two of the eight monitoring stations decreasing trends of annual contaminant load could be detected. We conclude that any of the tested load calculation procedures can be applied, as loads do no differ systematically. Although a high uncertainty in load estimation exists (e.g. maximum percentage error of E = [18{$\cdot$}1, 122{$\cdot$}5]\% for HCB), the monitoring programme at the Rhine is adequate for analysing the long-term chemical status of SM.

With a production of huge data sets and their processing in real-time applications, the needs for environmental data management have grown significantly. Numerous examples from practice of EIMSs prove that the architecture of DBMS should be open for a permanent evolution. Current trends in database development and an associated research meet these challenges. New information and communication technologies and techniques influence today's DBMSs. They include, among other things, sensor networks, stream processing, processing uncertain and imprecise data, knowledge discovery and intelligent data analysis, as well as wireless broadcast and mobile computing. Both research and practice indicate that the traditional universal DBMS architecture hardly satisfies these trends and new solutions are needed. Rather separate specialized engines connected into networks are beneficial.

Diatoms have an absolute requirement for silicon to build-up their silicified cell wall in the form of two shells (the frustule). To date, changes in diatom cell wall silicification have been only studied in response to changes in the growth environment, with consistent increase in diatom silica content when specific growth rates decrease under nutrient or light limitations. Here, we report the first evidence for grazing-induced changes in cell wall silicification in a marine diatom. Cells grown in preconditioned media that had contained both diatoms and herbivores are significantly more silicified than diatoms grown in media that have contained diatoms alone or starved herbivores. These observations suggest that grazing-induced increase in cell wall silicification can be viewed as an adaptive reaction in habitats with variable grazing pressure, and demonstrate that silicification in diatoms is not only a constitutive mechanical protection for the cell, but also a phenotypically plastic trait modulated by grazing. In turn, our results corroborate the idea that plant-herbivore interactions, beyond grazing sensu stricto, contribute to drive ecosystem structure and biogeochemical cycles in the ocean.

  abstract = {In the future, the land system will be facing new intersecting challenges. While food demand, especially for resource-intensive livestock based commodities, is expected to increase, the terrestrial system has large potentials for climate change mitigation through improved agricultural management, providing biomass for bioenergy, and conserving or even enhancing carbon stocks of ecosystems. However, uncertainties in future socio-economic land use drivers may result in very different land-use dynamics and consequences for land-based ecosystem services. This is the first study with a systematic interpretation of the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) in terms of possible land-use changes and their consequences for the agricultural system, food provision and prices as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, five alternative Integrated Assessment Models with distinctive land-use modules have been used for the translation of the SSP narratives into quantitative projections. The model results reflect the general storylines of the SSPs and indicate a broad range of potential land-use futures with global agricultural land of 4900 mio ha in 2005 decreasing by 743 mio ha until 2100 at the lower (SSP1) and increasing by 1080 mio ha (SSP3) at the upper end. Greenhouse gas emissions from land use and land use change, as a direct outcome of these diverse land-use dynamics, and agricultural production systems differ strongly across SSPs (e.g. cumulative land use change emissions between 2005 and 2100 range from -54 to 402 Gt CO2). The inclusion of land-based mitigation efforts, particularly those in the most ambitious mitigation scenarios, further broadens the range of potential land futures and can strongly affect greenhouse gas dynamics and food prices. In general, it can be concluded that low demand for agricultural commodities, rapid growth in agricultural productivity and globalized trade, all most pronounced in a SSP1 world, have the potential to enhance the extent of natural ecosystems, lead to lowest greenhouse gas emissions from the land system and decrease food prices over time. The SSP-based land use pathways presented in this paper aim at supporting future climate research and provide the basis for further regional integrated assessments, biodiversity research and climate impact analysis.},

  abstract = {Growing awareness of the wider environmental significance of fine sediment transport by rivers and associated sediment problems linked to sediment{\textendash}water quality interactions, nutrient and contaminant transfer, and the degradation of aquatic habitats has resulted in the need for an improved understanding of the mobilization and transfer of sediment in catchments to support the development of effective sediment management strategies. The sediment budget provides a key integrating concept for assembling information on the internal functioning of a catchment in terms of its sediment dynamics by providing information on the mobilization, transfer, storage and output of sediment. One key feature of a catchment sediment budget is the relationship between the sediment yield at the catchment outlet and rates of sediment mobilization and transfer within the catchment, which is commonly represented by the sediment delivery ratio. To date, most attempts to derive estimates of this ratio have been based on a comparison of the measured sediment yield from a catchment with an estimate of the erosion occurring within the catchment, derived from an erosion prediction procedure, such as the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) or its revised version, RUSLE. There is a need to obtain more direct and spatially distributed evidence of the erosion rates occurring within a catchment and to characterize the links between sediment mobilization, transfer, storage and output more explicitly. In this context, fallout radionuclides have proved particularly useful as sediment tracers. This paper reports the results of a study aimed at exploring the use of caesium-137 (137Cs) measurements to establish sediment budgets for three catchments of different sizes and contrasting land use located in Calabria, southern Italy. Long-term measurements of sediment output were available for the catchments, and, by using the estimates of gross and net rates of soil loss within the catchments provided by 137Cs measurements, it was possible to establish the key components of the sediment budget for each catchment. By documenting the sediment budgets of three catchments of different sizes, the study provides a basis for exploring the effects of scale on catchment sediment budgets and, in particular, the increasing importance of catchment storage as the size of the catchment increases. The results of this study demonstrate a reduction in the sediment delivery ratio from 98 to 2\% as catchment area increases from 1{$\cdot$}47 ha to 31{$\cdot$}2 km2.

The developed model was used to predict the evolution of meandering planforms. Then, the modeling results were analyzed and compared to the observed data. Because the migration of meandering channels consists of downstream translation, lateral expansion, and downstream or upstream rotations, several measures are formulated to determine which of the resulting planform is closest to the experimental measured one. Results from the deterministic model highly depend on the calibrated erosion coefficient. Because field measurements are always limited, the stochastic model yielded more realistic predictions of meandering planform evolutions. Because the coefficient of bank erosion is a random variable, the meandering planform evolution is a stochastic process that can only be accurately predicted by a stochastic model.},

Our first results reveal that the deformation and erosion dynamics of bed material mainly depends on its miscible state with the flume fluid, its structural organization being associated with mechanical properties and the measurement section. Shear localization within the bed is also observed. Moreover, the erosion rate and the local bed shear stress can vary with time even for an imposed constant global hydrodynamic flow as they result from the coupling between the fluid flow and cohesive bed conditions at the bottom. We also try to link the local resistance to erosion to the local cohesive strength estimated from rheometric microscopic data for the same sample conditions with homogeneous properties.},

  abstract = {The grain size distributions of bed load collected during flows that range from the threshold of motion to near bankfull in Nahal Eshtemoa, a coarse-grained ephemeral stream of southern Israel, give an unequivocal quantification of the change from unequal to near-equal mobility of grains of all available sizes. This second threshold occurs at {$\sim$}4.5 times the shear stress associated with initial motion (4.5{\cyrchar\cyrt}c). The level determined in Eshtemoa is much higher than previously defined by laboratory flume studies. The difference probably reflects the tighter packing and the greater interlock of natural streambeds and carries implications for a number of issues, including the modeling of sediment transport, especially in the context of dryland reservoir sedimentation. The proportion of time that flow exceeds 4.5{\cyrchar\cyrt}c determines the size distribution of cumulative bed load. Using a flow duration/sediment transport approach, in which fractional transport rates by grain size class are predicted with Parker's [1979] bed load function, it can be shown that the size distribution of bed load coarsens as the flow duration curve of individual flash floods incorporates progressively higher flows of variable duration. The method has utility because simple flood parameters such as peak discharge are imperfect predictors of sediment flux, particularly in desert streams where the shape of the flood hydrograph varies considerably from event to event. It is also shown that over a longer period (annual or decadal) the caliber of cumulative bed load depends upon the spectrum of flows in incident floods. The 4-year hydrograph record in Eshtemoa provides a model-derived bed load size distribution just finer than the unarmored bed material. The Eshtemoa data set can also be used to show clearly that water discharge in this type of ephemeral stream is ``effective'' or ``dominant'' over a wide range of flow stage ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 times bankfull and that bankfull discharge is no more significant than a wide range of other states of flow in transporting bed load.},

In this study, an attempt was made to use the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model and Geospatial techniques in an integrated way for modeling runoff and sediment yield for Khadakohol and Harsul watersheds in India. The SWAT model was calibrated for the monsoon months of a year and validated for other years. In countries like India, quantification of runoff/sediment yield is mainly constrained by the nonavailability of observed data and hence, regionalization of parameters was attempted, where the calibrated parameters from Khadakohol was used to Harsul and its applicability was assessed in an ungauged context and the results are found to be encouraging.},

Hydrodynamic (non-MHD) flow is first considered. The effect of a homogeneous stream-wise magnetic field on the transition characteristics is then studied under the Quasi-static approximation of Magnetohydrodynamics, applicable, when the induced magnetic field is neglected. The Reynolds number of the flows is limited to Re {$\leq$} 100 and selected values of the Interaction parameter (N) measuring the relative strength of the Lorentz force over the inertia in the range N {$\in$} [0,100] are considered. The temporal growth rate of the transverse velocity component at the location of the first (steady-state) maximum along the symmetry-line is shown to be a more informative and a more easily obtainable measure of asymmetry over other steady-state measures usually used in the literature. This growth rate is found to be independent of the symmetric initial conditions used for the computation and can be exploited in faster evaluation of the critical Reynolds number for the symmetric to asymmetric flow transition. An increase in the strength of the applied magnetic field N is found to have a stabilizing influence in general, reducing the growth rates of asymmetry. The (two equally sized) recirculation zone lengths of the steady-state symmetric solution are found to scale linearly with t√he Reynolds number (Re) for a fixed strength of the applied magnetic field and directly proportional to ReN and N for Re {$<<$} N and Re {$>>$} N cases respectively.},

  abstract = {This paper describes two new versions of the controlled random search procedure for global optimization (CRS). Designed primarily to suit the user of a CAD workstation, these algorithms can also be used effectively in other contexts. The first, known as CRS3, speeds the final convergence of the optimization by combining a local optimization algorithm with the global search procedure. The second, called CCRS, is a concurrent version of C RS3. This algorithm is intended to drive an optimizing accelerator, based on a concurrent processing architecture, which can be attached to a workstation to achieve a significant increase in speed. The results are given of comparative trials which involve both unconstrained and constrained optimization.},

  abstract = {We examine some of the processes that determine the properties of marginal sea outflows by reviewing historical data and by an analysis of two simple models. Our numerical simulation model makes several of the streamtube approximations of Smith (1975), but goes on to include a Froude number-dependent entrainment parameterization, an Ekman number-dependent parameterization of broadening, and it can accept real bottom topography and real oceanic temperature and salinity profiles. This numerical model reproduces some of the main features of the four major outflows considered here (Mediterranean Sea, two from the Norwegian-Greenland Sea, and Weddell Sea) including the bulk properties of the product water. A notable feature of these four outflows is that the density ordering of the source waters and product waters is reversed; for example, the densest source water comes from the Mediterranean Sea, the Mediterranean outflow makes the least dense product water. The reason is that intense entrainment of North Atlantic Central Water decreases the density of the Mediterranean outflow by about 1kg m-3 as it begins to descend the continental slope. The three high-latitude outflows are more or less similar in that strong entrainment generally occurs over short segments of the path where the bottom topography is relatively steep, typically just beyond the shelf-slope break. However, the densities of these outflows are decreased much less by entrainment (about 0.1kgm-3 in the Denmark Strait outflow, about 0.2kg m-3 in the Faroe Bank Channel outflow and 0.03kg m-3 in the Weddell Sea outflow) as they descend to the bottom in their respective basins. Entrainment causes much less decrease in density in these outflows primarily because of the lower density differences between these outflows and their overlying oceanic waters. High latitude outflows are more likely to reach the bottom because the oceanic water column in polar and subpolar seas is weakly stratified. These and other results indicate that the temperature and salinity of the oceanic water column are of considerable importance in determining the product water of a marginal sea outflow. Numerical experiments suggest that the density of the product water is remarkably insensitive to variations in the density of the source water. For example, if the density of the Mediterranean source water is arbitrarily increased by 1kg m-3, then the increased density difference between outflow and overlying oceanic water results in even more vigorous entrainment. This increases the transport of product water by about 106m3s-1 and limits the increase in density of the product water to only about 0.15kg m-3. These and other results are obtained also from a simple end-point model of a descending outflow.},

  abstract = {Mapping the streambed morphology is crucial for understanding fluvial forms and processes, for advancing both our knowledge and best management practice of riverine systems. It is often done by wading streams but recently topobathymetric Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and imagery captured from airborne platforms are becoming promising and effective surveying methodologies. The recent use of remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS) combined with structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetric processing provides a novel, high-resolution approach to modelling fluvial morphology. Nevertheless, a complicating factor of such data acquisition in fluvial settings is linked to water bodies, whose presence introduces errors and distortions because of light reflection and refraction at the air{\textendash}water interface. Although proof-of-concept research has shown it is possible to reduce the effects of refraction in certain settings (e.g., clear waters, unbroken surfaces), corresponding validation methods remain limited to point-based assessments of error, these being typically limited to accessible parts of the channel. Here, we provide the first high-resolution, spatially continuous validation of a stream reach bathymetry surveyed with SfM and corrected with an advanced refraction method. This method required only the camera co-ordinates and is available as open source, coded in C++. We used RPAS imagery from a regulated reach of the Palancia River, Spain, where a diversion structure fully dewatered the reach and let us obtain the entire streambed topography, which we used as spatially continuous control topography to compare the bathymetry surveyed from imagery during normal flow conditions. We compared this method with the small angle refraction correction (SARC), which has less data requirements, and analysed the error distribution across habitat types (i.e. pools and riffles). These results showed that our approach had smaller errors than SARC in both habitat types, especially in the riffle. By analysing the relationship between error and channel roughness obtained from our dry-bed model, we found that the greatest errors arise in the peripheral zones of the water surface and in its areas where streambed roughness generates more turbulence. Quantitative validation confirmed the reliability of our method as a relatively low-cost tool for the modelling and management of geomorphology and habitat within small {\textendash} to medium-sized streams.}

In contrast to other conventional MCDM techniques, SMCA has the ability to address uneven spatial distribution of criteria values in the evaluation and ranking of alternatives under various uncertainties. Using this technique, a new flood management tool has been developed within the framework of widely used GIS software ArcGIS. This tool has a user friendly interface which allows construction of user defined criteria, running of SCP computations under uncertain impacting factors and visualization of results. This tool has also the ability to interact with and use of classified Remote Sensing (RS) image layers, and other GIS feature layers like census block boundaries for flood damage calculation and loss of life estimation. The 100-year flood management strategy for Oconee River near the City of Milledgeville, Georgia, USA is chosen as a case study to demonstrate the capabilities of the software. The test result indicates that this new SMCA tool provides a very versatile environment for spatial comparison of various flood mitigation alternatives by taking into account various uncertainties, which will greatly enhance the quality of the decision making process. This tool can also be easily modified and implemented for solving a large variety of problems related to natural resources planning and management.},

The PEST calibration procedure was used to calibrate the flow in the Chaohe River Basin and analyze parameter sensitivity. The daily flow data of Dage Station for 1975-1985 were used for calibration, and the daily flow for 1986-1990 were used for verification. The flow simulation results at Dage Station are: during the calibration period, the Nash{\textendash}Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients (Ens) is 0.80, and the coefficient of determination(R2) is 0.80; during the verification period, the Ens is 0.59, and the R2 is 0.65. The results show that the HSPF model has good applicability in the Chaohe River Basin. However, the simulation results of Gubeikou and Xiahui stations were poor during the peak period, resulting in unsatisfactory overall flow simulation results at the two stations. Therefore, a multi-target calibration method still needs to be used to make the simulation results of all three stations ideal.},

(1) set out to meet the needs of policymakers and earth-system modelers to better understand the future of soil erosion this century. Policymakers need this insight because of the constraints erosion places on achievement of multiple sustainable development goals including zero hunger, clean water and sanitation, no poverty, and life on land (2). The record of humankind does not induce confidence, evidencing our effect on soil distribution and quality and the consequences for past civilizations (3). The impact that soil erosion and deposition has on biogeochemical cycles (4{$\Downarrow$}{\textendash}6) is leading to a recognition that earth-system models (ESMs) must look beyond vertical exchanges between soil and atmosphere and address carbon cycle perturbation cause by lateral transport of soil from land to ocean (7). The study by Borrelli et al. (1) is, therefore, timely. Research, dating back as far as the 1930s and the stimulus of the Dust Bowl, has provided valuable insights into the causes and consequences of soil erosion. However, global synthesis of erosion rates measured using a wide range of methodologies, has proven to be extremely challenging (8). By applying an empirical soil erosion model employing consistent and high spatial resolution global datasets, Borrelli et al. (1) address this challenge and offer simulations that can be coupled in a consistent manner to land use, soil conservation, and climate change scenarios. Comparing modeled soil erosion for 2015 and 2070, Borrelli et al. (1) identify potential for {$\sim$}10\% reduction in global rates under a sustainability-focused scenario (SSP1-RCP2.6), {$\sim$}10\% increase in global rates for a fossil-fuel intensive scenario (SSP5-RCP8.5), and relatively little change (+2\%) for an intermediate scenario (SSP2-RCP4.5). These results suggest cobenefits for erosion reduction in attempts to pursue a path {\dots}  [↵][1]1To whom correspondence may be addressed. Email: t.a.quine\{at\}exeter.ac.uk.

  abstract = {Because of numerous practical implications of uncertainty in measured data and model predictions, improved techniques are needed to analyze and understand uncertainty and incorporate it into hydrologic and water quality evaluations. In the present study, a correction factor was developed to incorporate measurement uncertainty and model uncertainty in evaluations of model goodness-of-fit (predictive ability). The correction factor, which was developed for pairwise comparisons of measured and predicted values, modifies the typical error term calculation to consider both sources of uncertainty. The correction factor was applied with common distributions and levels of uncertainty (represented by coefficients of variation ranging from 0.026 to 0.256) for each measured value and each predicted value from five example data sets. The modifications resulted in inconsequential changes in goodness-of-fit conclusions for example data sets with very good and poor model simulations, which is both logical and appropriate because very good model performance should not improve greatly and poor model performance should not become satisfactory when uncertainty is considered. In contrast, incorporating uncertainty in example data sets with initially moderate goodness-of-fit resulted in important improvements in indicator values and in model performance ratings. A model evaluation matrix was developed to present appropriate model performance conclusions, considering both model accuracy and precision, based on various levels of measurement and model uncertainty. In cases with highly uncertain calibration/validation data, definitive ``good'' fit conclusions are cautioned against even with ``good'' indicator values because of the uncertain standard of comparison; however, in these cases, poor model accuracy can be confidently concluded from ``unsatisfactory'' indicator values. In contrast, model accuracy can be confidently concluded from goodness-of-fit indicator values in cases with low measurement uncertainty. It is hoped that the modified goodness-of-fit indicators and the model evaluation matrix contribute to improved goodness-of-fit conclusions and to more complete assessments of model performance.},

SC-SAHEL explores performance of different EAs, such as the capability to escape local attractions, speed, convergence, etc., during population evolution as each individual EA suits differently to various response surfaces. The SC-SAHEL algorithm is benchmarked over 29 conceptual test functions, and a real-world hydropower reservoir model case study.

The study was carried out to estimate the impact of varying DEM resolutions on LS factor values in a small hilly watershed near Dehradun, India. The impact of various computational algorithms as well as varying slope exponents on LS factor values were also estimated. DEMs of different resolutions such as ASTER(30m), CARTOSAT(10m and 30m), SRTM(30m) and UAV generated DEM(18cm) were used for comparison. On comparison, LS factor generated using varying resolution DEMs including UAV generated DEM yielded similar results indicated by similar mean values, even though the maximum values in the study area varied slightly. Use of spatially distributed slope exponent values resulted in higher mean LS factor values from all the DEMs, except UAV generated one, when compared to the use of a constant, slope exponent value. All DEMs except UAV generated DEM, yielded lower LS factor values when multi-flow direction (MFD) algorithm was used for computation instead of single flow direction (SFD). The variations in results when using UAV DEM may be due to its ability to capture the micro topographical variations on the ground, which affects the various computational procedures. The LS factor results obtained using different computational procedures and algorithms needs to be validated using ground collected information of LS factor, for wider acceptability and use by soil erosion and geospatial modelling communities.},

We also evaluated the high-resolution regional climate models (RCMs) using five statistical bias correction methods (linear scaling, empirical quantile mapping, quantile mapping with linear transformation, quantile mapping with smoothing spline, and quantile mapping with gamma distribution) for future simulation of the SE and SY. Our result suggests that quantile mapping with gamma distribution-based bias correction method and ICHEC-EC-EARTH-RCA model best project the changes in precipitation and consequently, the rainfall{\textendash}runoff erosivity factor in the catchment. It is estimated that a 3.67{\textendash}11.08\% increase in rainfall{\textendash}runoff erosivity may result in a 3.7{\textendash}11.76\% increase in SE and SY in the catchment under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. In addition to this 1.6-thousand-hectare area will be included in high (10{\textendash}20 t ha{$^{-1}$} year{$^{-1}$}) to very severe ({$>$} 80 t ha{$^{-1}$} year{$^{-1}$}) SE intensity class during the near (2020{\textendash}2049) and far future (2070{\textendash}2099) period. The result also revealed that the increasing rate of SE and SY will be observed in the sub-catchment numbers 10, 18, 20, 23, 24, 27, 29 located in the middle part of the catchment under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The result may help the policymakers to strengthen the conservation strategy and more informed decisions for the management of catchment in and around the area.}

  abstract = {Sharp open channel bend flows are highly three-dimensional because of the combined effects of secondary flow, large free-surface variations, and flow separation along the inner bend wall. A comprehensive analysis was performed to determine the best modeling parameters to study the open channel sharp bend flow. Comparisons of the simulation results were made from two commercial codes, three turbulence models [k-{$\epsilon$} renormalization group (RNG), Reynolds stress model (RSM), and large eddy simulation (LES)], two flow domain representations [Cartesian and body-fitted coordinate (BFC) grids], and three water surface treatments [rigid lid, porosity, and volume of fluid (VOF)]. Based on a comparison with experimental data, the best results were obtained with software using the RSM and VOF approach. Adequate representation of counter-rotating secondary flow cells in the channel downstream of the bend requires both the appropriate treatment of the channel free surface and a turbulence model that can resolve the anisotropy of turbulence.

  abstract = {This study addresses the problem of modelling sediment erosion at the catchment scale, in order to predict the possible impact of reservoirs and land use changes on sediment load in South East Asia. The investigated basin is the Lo river basin, (38,165km2 in Viet Tri), a left tributary of the Red River, where the Thac Ba and the recently built Tuyen Quang reservoirs have already been changing downstream sediment load since 1971 and 2005 when they were, respectively, in operations. The RUSLE equation is adopted in a distributed GIS framework to assess catchment erosion, and is coupled with a sediment accumulation and routing scheme to model suspended sediment load in the Lo basin at a monthly scale. Monthly precipitation were collected and used as input to the model. Suspended sediment load data, measured at eight gauging stations in Vietnam, from 1959 to 2007, were compared with the model's simulated sediment yield. Resulting average Nash{\textendash}Sutcliffe efficiency is 0.45, ranging from 0.33 to 0.62 and bias is 5\% at Vu Quang, close to the basin outlet, and results 1.4\% by averaging biases at the eight stations, thus confirming that the model is adequate. Effects of reservoirs were analysed by modelling erosion and sediment yield passing from natural to impounded conditions and resulted in a suspended sediment load reduction of about 95\% and 75\% downstream, respectively, the Thac Ba reservoir in the Chay river and the Tuyen Quang reservoir in the Gam river. Land use change scenarios, parameterized on the basis of observed land use changes in the impounded basin and assuming that 20\% of forest area is converted into rice and agricultural crops and 15\% into bushes, shrubs and meadows, are expected to induce a 28\% increase of suspended sediment load which can compensate, at least in part, sedimentation in reservoirs. Also agricultural and hillslope maintenance practices can modify sediment erosion in the basin.},

  abstract = {This article presents an experimental study of the hydraulic transport of very large solid particles (above 5mm) in an horizontal pipe. Two specific masses are used for the solids. The solids are spheres that are large with respect to the diameter of the pipe (5\%, 10\% and 15\%) or real stones of arbitrary shapes but constant specific mass and a size distribution similar to the tested spherical beads. Finally, mixtures of size and/or specific mass are studied. The regimes are characterized with differential pressure measurements and visualizations. The results are compared to empirical models based on dimensionless numbers, together with 1D models that are based on mass and momentum balance. A model for the transport of large particles in vertical pipes is also proposed and tested on data available in the Literature, in order to compare the trends that are observed in the present experiments in a horizontal pipe to the trends predicted for a vertical pipe. The results show that the grain size and specific mass have a strong effect on the transition point between regimes with a stationary bed and dispersed flows. The pressure drops are moreover smaller for large particles in the horizontal part contrary to what occurs for vertical pipes, and to the predictions of the empirical correlations.},

  abstract = {Current expectation is that projected climate change may have adverse effects on fish habitats and survival. The analysis leading to these concerns is typically done at large scale with limited possibility to quantify the local biological response and compare with previous conditions. Our research investigated the effects of recorded climate conditions on Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawning and rearing habitats and growth responses to the local climate and compared those conditions to predicted responses to a climate change. The study site was a 7 km long reach of Bear Valley Creek, an important spawning stream for this US Endangered Species Act listed species, in the Pacific Northwest of United States. We used 2D numerical modeling supported by accurate, high-resolution survey data to calculate flow hydraulics at various discharges from base to bankfull flows. For past and future conditions, computed flow hydraulics were combined with habitat suitability indices (SI) to compute spawning and rearing habitat suitability. Information on habitat suitability along with fish density and stream water temperature informed a growth model to quantify the potential fish size, an index of survival rates and fitness. Our results indicate that yearly-averaged rearing habitat quality remains similar to historic, but the timing of high- and low-quality habitat periods shift within the calendar year. Future spawning habitat quality may be significantly reduced during the seasonal period to which Chinook have currently adapted their spawning behavior. The growth model indicates an increase in anticipated size of Chinook salmon for predicted future climate conditions due to water temperature increase. Consequently, future climate conditions may have a substantial negative impact on spawning and limited impact on rearing conditions due to flow reduction and thus quality and extent of available habitat. However, the expected warmer stream water temperatures may benefit rearing, because of increased fish size in these high elevation cold-water streams.},

On the basis of a theoretically founded modelling protocol, the different steps in distributed hydrological modelling are illustrated through a case study based on the MIKE SHE code and the 440 km2 Karup catchment in Denmark. The importance of a rigorous and purposeful parameterisation is emphasized in order to get as few ``free'' parameters as possible for which assessments through calibration are required. Calibration and validation using a split-sample procedure were carried out for catchment discharge and piezometric heads at seven selected observation wells. The validated model was then used for two further validation tests. Firstly, model simulations were compared with observations from three additional discharge sites and four additional wells located within the catchment. This internal validation showed significantly poorer results compared to the calibration/validation sites. Secondly, the validated model based on a 500 m model grid was used to generate three additional models with 1000 m, 2000 m and 4000 m grids through interpolation of model parameters. The results from the multi-scale validation suggested that a maximum grid size of 1000 m should be used for simulations of discharge and ground-water heads, while the results deteriorated with coarser model grids.},

  abstract = {Some scientists argue, with reference to Popper's scientific philosophical school, that models cannot be verified or validated. Other scientists and many practitioners nevertheless use these terms, but with very different meanings. As a result of an increasing number of examples of model malpractice and mistrust to the credibility of models, several modelling guidelines are being elaborated in recent years with the aim of improving the quality of modelling studies. This gap between the views and the lack of consensus experienced in the scientific community and the strongly perceived need for commonly agreed modelling guidelines is constraining the optimal use and benefits of models. This paper proposes a framework for quality assurance guidelines, including a consistent terminology and a foundation for a methodology bridging the gap between scientific philosophy and pragmatic modelling. A distinction is made between the conceptual model, the model code and the site-specific model. A conceptual model is subject to confirmation or falsification like scientific theories. A model code may be verified within given ranges of applicability and ranges of accuracy, but it can never be universally verified. Similarly, a model may be validated, but only with reference to sitespecific applications and to pre-specified performance (accuracy) criteria. Thus, a model's validity will always be limited in terms of space, time, boundary conditions and types of application. This implies a continuous interaction between manager and modeller in order to establish suitable accuracy criteria and predictions associated with uncertainty analysis.},

  abstract = {Automatic and continuously recording samplers are deployed in a Hertfordshire gravel-bed stream to show that bedload transport is related to stream power. The pattern is similar to that already established for North American channels but, because the record is so detailed, it is possible to identify the cause of the considerable scatter that is normal in such relationships. A major factor is the occurrence of rhythmic pulses in bedload discharge that are not matched by similar fluctuations in hydraulic variables. It is suggested that these pulses reflect downstream differences in the concentration of mobile particles in a slow-moving traction carpet, and that they may be likened to kinematic waves. The record also reveals that the threshold of sediment transport{\textemdash}always presumed hithero to be associated with incipient motion{\textemdash}is related to the cessation of bedload transport in a river flood. Indeed, the mean value of stream power at the finish of bedload transport is only 20 percent of that prevailing at the moment of incipient sediment motion. Because of this, there is an inevitably poor correlation between actual bedload transport rates and those predicted by bedload equations which rely upon a single traction threshold. These new data show that the general inverse relationship between bedload discharge and water-depth : grain-size ratio proposed by Bagnold (1977, 1980) is not universal. Transport efficiency for this gravel-bed stream is typically 0.05 per cent of available stream power, which compares with 1.6 per cent for a river moving both gravel and sand, and 5 per cent for another channel where bedload is composed predominantly of sand-sized particles. It is argued that coarse and fine-grained alluvial channels may need to be considered separately. By allowing for differences in traction threshold at the beginning and end of bedload events, and by averaging bedload discharge flood by flood in order to smooth out the effect of pulses, it is possible to achieve a reasonably good prediction of average bedload transport rate in terms of stream power.},

  abstract = {As demand for fresh water increases in tandem with human population growth and a changing climate, the need to understand the ecological tradeoffs of flow regulation gains greater importance. Environmental classification is a first step towards quantifying these tradeoffs by creating the framework necessary for analysing the effects of flow variability on riverine biota. Our study presents a spatially explicit hydrogeomorphic classification of streams and rivers in Washington State, USA and investigates how projected climate change is likely to affect flow regimes in the future. We calculated 99 hydrologic metrics from 15 years of continuous daily discharge data for 64 gauges with negligible upstream impact, which were entered into a Bayesian mixture model to classify flow regimes into seven major classes described by their dominant flow source as follows: groundwater (GW), rainfall (RF), rain-with-snow (RS), snow-and-rain (SandR), snow-with-rain (SR), snowmelt (SM) and ultra-snowmelt (US). The largest class sizes were represented by the transitional RS and SandR classes (14 and 12 gauges, respectively), which are ubiquitous in temperate, mountainous landscapes found in Washington. We used a recursive partitioning algorithm and random forests to predict flow class based on a suite of environmental and climate variables. Overall classification success was 75\%, and the model was used to predict normative flow classes at the reach scale for the entire state. Application of future climate change scenarios to the model inputs indicated shifts of varying magnitude from snow-dominated to rain-dominated flow classes. Lastly, a geomorphic classification was developed using a digital elevation model (DEM) and climatic data to assign stream segments as either dominantly able or unable to migrate, which was cross-tabulated with the flow types to produce a 14-tier hydrogeomorphic classification. The hydrogeomorphic classification provides a framework upon which empirical flow alteration{\textendash}ecological response relationships can subsequently be developed using ecological information collected throughout the region.

The knowledge is extended to large bend numbers, and a design procedure is presented. Supercritical bend flow in the smooth horizontal and rectangular channel is considered. It is found that the maximum standing wave heights are influenced by the bend number, that is, the approach Froude number times the square root of the average relative curvature. Current models are demonstrated to apply for relatively small bend numbers. For modest and large bend numbers, however, the flow pattern is modified. Besides the extreme wave lengths, the generalized surface profiles along either bend wall, the typical velocity fields, and the separation mechanism are experimentally studied. Also, a model for separated bend flow is developed. Photographs are presented that illustrate the uneven distribution of separated bend flow in regard to the cross-sectional area.

  abstract = {Man-made structures in the Saalach River have changed the hydromorphological characteristics of the river regime. In some river reaches, the Saalach has lost the high morphological versatility and high variation in sediment transport characteristic of a mountain river. Among the negative effects, an extreme flow discharge in combination with riverbed variation could be one of the possible causes of flood disasters along the river. For example, the heavy and long lasting rainfall in June 2013 led to a peak discharge of 1100\,m3/s, which was slightly above the 100-year flood return period, inundating a nearby city. However, the influence of the man-made structures on this flood event in this reach is unclear. In this study an integrative hydromorphological model is applied to evaluate this impact by a comparison with a standard clear water model with fixed bed. Moreover, a comparative analysis of a three-and two-dimensional flow model is performed to assess the models suitability representing the flow in this river stretch. The integrative model concept is based on the software TELEMAC-MASCARET, in an enhanced version for better representing graded sediment transport in rivers. In contrast to our integrative model, the standard clear water model with fixed bed overestimates the water elevations as it cannot take the significant changes in morphology into account. Results demonstrate that our proposed model more accurately represents the inundation in the floodplain and could thus be used to provide more reliable predictions to decision-makers for improved flood protection strategy.},

In this paper, we show that the performance of a numerical model can be improved by quantify boundary conditions, and that the simulation results of such a well-developed model will be more useful for civil engineers. As a case study, we develop a model system based on TELEMAC-SISYPHE to study the morphology of the Saalach River, where erosion and sedimentation impacts local ecology and human safety. Based on the available measurements and a sediment balance concept, we estimate the amount of sediment supplied to the river section downstream of a reservoir as well as the volume of the bed sediment transported along the river channel in different years. Using this information as boundary conditions for calibration and validation cases, the model provides a realistic and accurate representation of the river. Furthermore, our model has been successfully employed on the Saalach River to evaluate an alternative strategy for a more sustainable river management.},

The calibrated bed elevation was used as the initial bed for a number of simulations with different discharge regimes under varying operational schemes. By comparing the simulated results, we propose an appropriate flushing scheme in terms of intensity and duration to obtain a balance of sediment regime in the river. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such an optimised sediment management can generate synergies for improving measures of flood protection.},

No definitive relationship was found between sediment size and concentration, and alevin and fry quality.

The method applies to tension infiltration from either a surface disk or from within a ring inserted a small distance into the soil. The analysis employs a modification of Wooding's solution for infiltration from a shallow pond, combined with numerically determined shape factors that account for the interaction effects between flow geometry and soil properties. The method is found, via numerical simulations, to have an overall accuracy within about {$\pm$} 7\%, regardless of whether the predicted K({$\psi$}) function is flat with an indistinct air-entry value, steep with a distinct air-entry value, or very steep with no air-entry value. Some important practical features of the method are that it does not require measurement of the often-difficult square-root-of-time infiltration behavior, no special considerations are required regarding the thickness of the contact layer, it minimizes the effect of local spatial heterogeneity by using only one infiltration surface per set of K({$\psi$}) measurements, it avoids the use of potentially unstable simultaneous-equations solution procedures, and it can be applied to tension infiltration from both disk and ring infiltrometers.},

In this study, fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks were used as intelligent tools to synthesize petrophysical logs including neutron, density, sonic and deep resistivity. The petrophysical data from two wells were used for constructing intelligent models in the Fahlian limestone reservoir, Southern Iran. A third well from the field was used to evaluate the reliability of the models. The results showed that fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks were successful in synthesizing wireline logs. The combination of the results obtained from fuzzy logic and neural networks in a simple averaging committee machine (CM) showed a significant improvement in the accuracy of the estimations. This committee machine performed better than fuzzy logic or the neural network model in the problem of estimating petrophysical properties from well logs.}

  abstract = {This paper presents the overview of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and their energy, land use, and emissions implications. The SSPs are part of a new scenario framework, established by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to global energy consumption of 400{\textendash}1200 EJ in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100. The associated annual CO2 emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100. With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for reaching the target of 2.6W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2{\textdegree}C, differs in our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the SSP marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach this target from the SSPs with high mitigation challenges. While the SSPs were designed to represent different mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects. Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions, further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the SSP scenarios with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

  abstract = {Human demands on the world's available freshwater supplies continue to grow as the global population increases. In the endeavor to manage water to meet human needs, the needs of freshwater species and ecosystems have largely been neglected, and the ecological consequences have been tragic. Healthy freshwater ecosystems provide a wealth of goods and services for society, but our appropriation of freshwater flows must be better managed if we hope to sustain these benefits and freshwater biodiversity. We offer a framework for developing an ecologically sustainable water management program, in which human needs for water are met by storing and diverting water in a manner that can sustain or restore the ecological integrity of affected river ecosystems. Our six-step process includes: (1) developing initial numerical estimates of key aspects of river flow necessary to sustain native species and natural ecosystem functions; (2) accounting for human uses of water, both current and future, through development of a computerized hydrologic simulation model that facilitates examination of human-induced alterations to river flow regimes; (3) assessing incompatibilities between human and ecosystem needs with particular attention to their spatial and temporal character; (4) collaboratively searching for solutions to resolve incompatibilities; (5) conducting water management experiments to resolve critical uncertainties that frustrate efforts to integrate human and ecosystem needs; and (6) designing and implementing an adaptive management program to facilitate ecologically sustainable water management for the long term. Drawing from case studies around the world to illustrate our framework, we suggest that ecologically sustainable water management is attainable in the vast majority of the world's river basins. However, this quest will become far less feasible if we wait until water supplies are further over-appropriated. Corresponding Editor: J. S. Baron.},

It is generally accepted that these techniques need to be calibrated. Several studies are summarized here which used one of the following acoustic measuring systems: Swiss impact plate geophone, Japanese pipe hydrophone, other impact plate systems, and underwater microphones. Many of these acoustic measuring techniques were applied and tested not only in a laboratory environment but also in natural streams at sites where independent, direct bedload transport measurements were available. Some of these acoustic measuring systems were successfully calibrated for total bedload flux under field conditions. More recent investigations also considered the possibility to extract information on grain-size classes from the acoustic signal. This review furthermore points out important issues related to system calibration and discusses some operational aspects to be considered for different systems.},

  abstract = {Previous measurements of bed load transport in gravel bed streams revealed a large temporal and spatial variability of bed load transport rates. Using an impact plate geophone system, continuous bed load transport measurements were made during 6 years in two mountain streams in Austria. The two streams have a snow-melt and glacier-melt dominated hydrologic regime resulting in frequent transport activity during the summer half year. Periods of days to weeks were identified which are associated with approximately constant Shields values that indicate quasi-stable bed conditions. Between these stable periods, the position of the bed load transport function varied while its steepness remained approximately constant. For integration time scales of several hours to 1 day, the fluctuations in bed load transport decreased and the correlation between bed load transport and water discharge increased. For integration times of about 70{\textendash}100 days, bed load transport is determined by discharge or shear stress to within a factor of about 2, relative to the 6 year mean level. Bed load texture increased with increasing mean flow strength and mean transport intensity. Weak and predominantly clockwise daily hysteresis of bed load transport was found for the first half of the summer period.},

  abstract = {The Swiss plate geophone (SPG) system has been installed and tested in more than 20 steep gravel-bed streams and rivers, and related studies generally resulted in rather robust calibration relations between signal impulse counts and transported bedload mass. Here, we compare this system with three alternative surrogate measuring systems. A variant of the SPG system uses the same frame (housing) set-up but with an accelerometer instead of a geophone sensor to measure the vibrations of the plate (GP-Acc, for geophone plate accelerometer). The miniplate accelerometer (MPA) system has a smaller dimension of the impact plate and is embedded in more elastomer material than the SPG system. The Japanese pipe microphone (JPM) is a 1 m long version of the system that has been installed in many streams in Japan. To compare the performance of the four systems, we used calibration measurements with direct bedload samples from three field sites and an outdoor flume facility with controlled sediment feed. At our field sites, the systems with an accelerometer and a microphone showed partly large temporal variations in the background noise level, which may have impaired the calibration measurements obtained during certain time periods. Excluding these periods, the SPG, GP-Acc, and JPM all resulted in robust calibration relations, whereas the calibration of the MPA system showed a poorer performance at all sites.},

The snow algorithm uses the NDSI in combination with near-infrared reflectance to identify snow cover and discriminate snow from clouds. The NDSI-based snow algorithm functions with a simple set of decision rules for snow, and can be run in an automated fashion on any TM scene without a priori knowledge of surface characteristics. Consistent identification of snow cover in a variety of TM scenes has been attained with the algorithm. Snow mapping results from TM imagery of the Glacier National Park, Montana region are presented. This algorithm is expected to generate global snow cover data products in the EOS era beginning in 1998.{$<>$}},

High-quality bed-load transport data sets are identified and analyzed, showing that the bed-load transport in the sand range is related to velocity to power 2.5. The bed-load transport is not much affected by particle size. The prediction of bed roughness is addressed and the prediction of bed-load transport in steady river flow is extended to coastal flow applying an intrawave approach. Simplified bed-load transport formulas are presented, which can be used to obtain a quick estimate of bed-load transport in river and coastal flows. It is shown that the sediment transport of fine silts to coarse sand can be described in a unified model framework using fairly simple expressions. The proposed model is fully predictive in the sense that only the basic hydrodynamic parameters (depth, current velocity, wave height, wave period, etc.) and the basic sediment characteristics (d10d10{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}msub{$><$}mi{$>$}d{$<$}/mi{$><$}mn{$>$}10{$<$}/mn{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$}, d50d50{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}msub{$><$}mi{$>$}d{$<$}/mi{$><$}mn{$>$}50{$<$}/mn{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$}, d90d90{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}msub{$><$}mi{$>$}d{$<$}/mi{$><$}mn{$>$}90{$<$}/mn{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$}, water temperature, and salinity) need to be known.

Even critical, fundamental operations such as cross-calibrations of related sensors operating on different platforms or orbits, e.g. spacecraft and aircraft, are integrative analyses. The great variety of Earth Science data types and the spatiotemporal irregularity of important low-level (ungridded) data has so far made their integration a customized, tedious process which scales in neither variety nor volume. Generic, higher-level (gridded) data products are easier to use, at the cost of being farther from the original observations and having to settle with grids, interpolation assumptions, and uncertainties that limit their applicability. The root cause of the difficulty in scalably bringing together diverse data is the current rectilinear geo-partitioning of Earth Science data into conventional arrays indexed using consecutive integer indices and then packaged into files. Such indices suffice for archival, search, and retrieval, but lack a common geospatial semantics, which is mitigated by adding on floating-point encoded longitude-latitude information for registration. An alternative to floating-point, the SpatioTemporal Adaptive Resolution Encoding (STARE) provides an~integer encoding for geo-spatiotemporal location and neighborhood that transcends the use of files and native array indexing, allowing diverse data to be organized on scalable, distributed computing and storage platforms.},

  abstract = {Previous experimental, field, and modeling studies of confluence dynamics have focused mainly on junctions formed by straight channels. In contrast, natural rivers often meander and tributaries can enter meandering rivers on the outside of bends to form a junction planform known as a confluent meander bend. In this study, field measurements of three-dimensional velocity components and bed topography at a confluent meander bend reveal a complex hydrodynamic environment that responds to changes in momentum-flux ratio, while channel morphology remains relatively stable. Flow from the tributary deflects high-velocity flow and helical motion in the curving main river toward the inside of the bend, inducing bed scour and inhibiting point-bar development. The high junction angle forces the tributary flow to abruptly realign to the orientation of the downstream channel, initiating a counter-rotating helical cell over the outer portion of the bend. Two surfaceconvergent helical cells persist through the downstream channel, where the combined flows accelerate as the channel cross-sectional area is constricted by a bar along the downstream junction corner, precluding flow separation. Long-term stability of its planform suggests that this confluent meander bend represents a quasistable channel configuration. Overall, patterns of flow and channel morphology are quite different from typical patterns in most meander bends, but are generally consistent with a conceptual model of confluent meander bends derived from previous laboratory experiments and numerical modeling.},

  abstract = {A new index has been developed for the hydromorphological assessment of Italian rivers. The method was designed to comply with the EU Water Framework Directive requirements, but its use can be extended to other applications in river management. The evaluation of stream morphological quality is preceded by a phase of river segmentation, consisting of an initial division of the network into river reaches with homogeneous morphological characteristics. The evaluation procedure consists of a set of 28 indicators, which were defined to assess longitudinal and lateral continuity, channel pattern, cross section configuration, bed structure and substrate, and vegetation in the riparian corridor. These characteristics are analyzed in terms of geomorphological functionality, artificiality, and channel adjustments. Indicators, classes, and the scoring system were defined based on expert judgement. The scoring system leads to the definition of the Morphological Quality Index (MQI). Application of the method to 102 river reaches covering a wide range of physical conditions and human pressures of Italian streams enabled the testing of the overall methodology and the refinement of the indicators and scores. Limitations, strengths, and the applicability of the method are also discussed in the paper.},

  abstract = {Riverbank retreat derives from a complex combination of various processes where a key role is played by the interactions of groundwater and surface water. Recent progress has been made in two main research areas, i.e.,~the effects of hydrological factors on mass failures, and the role of subsurface flow in seepage erosion and bank stability. This paper aims to review recent progress and identify the main knowledge gaps in modeling riverbank failures, with a particular focus on the interactions between mass failures, bank hydrology and other hydrological factors related to the river hydrograph. Changes in pore water pressures related to transient variations of surface water and groundwater are widely recognized as one of the most important factors controlling the onset and timing of bank instability. Inclusion of negative pore water pressures and groundwater flow modeling has greatly improved the capability to predict mass failures. Fluvial erosion has a fundamental role in deforming the bank profile and, therefore, promoting bank instability. However, fluvial erosion may also affect bank stability indirectly, as deformation of the bank profile alters the pore water pressure field within the bank. Seepage flow determines an important control on bank instability by two mechanisms: hydraulic gradient forces, causing possible mass failure or liquefaction; and seepage erosion and undercutting, eventually inducing a collapse of the upper bank. This review has led to the identification of the main knowledge gaps and needs for future research in two main areas: (1)~parameterization of various soil properties that need to be accounted for when modeling hydrologic processes and mass failures; and (2)~the need for integrated modeling of seepage and fluvial erosion and how they simultaneously may affect mass failures.},

The framework builds on existing and up-to-date geomorphological concepts and approaches and has been tested on several Italian streams. The framework includes the following four phases: (1) catchment-wide characterization of the fluvial system; (2) evolutionary trajectory reconstruction and assessment of current river conditions; (3) description of future trends of channel evolution; and (4) identification of management options. The framework provides specific consideration of the temporal context, in terms of reconstructing the trajectory of past channel evolution as a basis for interpreting present river conditions and future trends. A series of specific tools has been developed for the assessment of river conditions, in terms of morphological quality and channel dynamics. These include: the Morphological Quality Index (MQI), the Morphological Dynamics Index (MDI), the Event Dynamics Classification (EDC), and the river morphodynamic corridors (MC and EMC). The monitoring of morphological parameters and indicators, alongside the assessment of future scenarios of channel evolution provides knowledge for the identification, planning and prioritization of actions for enhancing morphological quality and risk mitigation.},

The procedure includes components that categorise river channel morphology, floodplain morphology, flow regime, and groundwater{\textemdash}surface water interactions, and is designed for operational use in the context of river management. Channel morphology is classified at a first level by a basic river typology interpreted using remotely sensed images, and at a second level by an extended river typology that integrates information from field observations. Floodplains are classified by adopting the Nanson and Croke typology with specific reference to the types of floodplain that are most likely to be encountered widely across Europe. Nine flow regime types are identified using a series of hydrological indicators. Finally, where groundwater has a significant influence on river flows, a range of potential groundwater{\textemdash}surface water interactions are identified reflecting the morphological river type and its geological and climatic setting. Within the REFORM project, the river typology has been tested using case studies representative of a wide variety of European catchment conditions. Four case studies are used to illustrate the classification procedure and to discuss its main strengths and limitations.},

  abstract = {Over the past few decades, numerous floodplain restoration projects have attempted to re-establish complex and diverse river floodplains. They often aim to restore lateral connectivity (i.e. interactions between the main river channel and floodplain channels) and rejuvenate floodplain habitats which are no longer maintained or created by fluvial processes. Nonetheless, results of these experiences in terms of hydromorphological conditions and adjustments are rarely shared. The Rh{\^o}ne River is a large, highly regulated system where lateral connectivity has been greatly reduced. We investigated habitat dynamics (using sedimentological indicators as proxies) in 18 floodplain channels that were restored between 1999 and 2006. Environmental data (bathymetry and grain size of surficial fine sediments) were acquired on 3{\textendash}5 surveys for each channel covering 6{\textendash}12 years after restoration. In addition, a pre-restoration survey was made in 12 of the 18 channels. Using pressure sensors in the floodplain channels and rating curves in the main channel, we quantified the upstream overflow frequency and magnitude (i.e. maximum shear stress) in the channels and tested how these variables explain observed sedimentological patterns. Between-channel diversity accounted for 81\% of the sedimentological variability observed after restoration. Time-averaged sedimentological conditions were robust and well predicted from overflow frequency and magnitude. Similarly, an indirect index of lateral connectivity used by hydrobiologists was also predictable from overflow frequency and magnitude. The remaining 19\% of the sedimentological variability was attributed to temporal variation within channels and was mainly related to changes in longitudinal grain size gradient. This emphasises that grain size patterns are periodically reworked as a result of the flooding regime (backflow versus overflow) without significantly affecting average grain sizes. However, trajectories of grain size changes were stochastic and not always related to the hydrological regime. Accordingly, the partial pre-restoration data suggest that post-restoration sedimentological conditions were often similar to those observed before restoration, except in a few channels where major restoration works were performed. Our results quantify how changes in upstream overflow frequency and magnitude can modify physical conditions in the floodplain channels. They can be used to design habitats that are infrequent or missing at the floodplain scale. These results also suggest that changes in upstream plug morphology are a primary habitat driver. Such changes could be more frequently implemented in the Rh{\^o}ne and elsewhere to maximise the diversity of physical conditions in floodplains.},

  abstract = {Gridded data products, for example interpolated daily measurements of precipitation from weather stations, are commonly used as a convenient substitute for direct observations because these products provide a spatially and temporally continuous and complete source of data. However, when the goal is to characterize climatological features of extreme precipitation over a spatial domain (e.g., a map of return values) at the native spatial scales of these phenomena, then gridded products may lead to incorrect conclusions because daily precipitation is a fractal field and hence any smoothing technique will dampen local extremes. To address this issue, we create a new ``probabilistic'' gridded product specifically designed to characterize the climatological properties of extreme precipitation by applying spatial statistical analysis to daily measurements of precipitation from the Global Historical Climatology Network over the contiguous United States. The essence of our method is to first estimate the climatology of extreme precipitation based on station data and then use a data-driven statistical approach to interpolate these estimates to a fine grid. We argue that our method yields an improved characterization of the climatology within a grid cell because the probabilistic behavior of extreme precipitation is much better behaved (i.e., smoother) than daily weather. Furthermore, the spatial smoothing innate to our approach significantly increases the signal-to-noise ratio in the estimated extreme statistics relative to an analysis without smoothing. Finally, by deriving a data-driven approach for translating extreme statistics to a spatially complete grid, the methodology outlined in this paper resolves the issue of how to properly compare station data with output from earth system models. We conclude the paper by comparing our probabilistic gridded product with a standard extreme value analysis of the Livneh gridded daily precipitation product.

Issues such as water turbidity, associated contaminants, reservoir sedimentation, undesirable erosion and scour, and aquatic habitat are all linked to sediment properties and behaviors. In situ analysis is necessary to develop an understanding of the erosion and transport of sediments. Sandia National Laboratories has recently patented the Adjustable Shear Stress Erosion and Transport ͑ASSET͒ Flume that quantifies in situ erosion of a sediment core with depth while affording simultaneous examination of transport modes ͑bedload versus suspended load͒ of the eroded material. Core erosion rates and ratios of bedload to suspended load transport of quartz sediments were studied with the ASSET Flume. The erosion and transport of a fine-grained natural cohesive sediment were also observed. Experiments using quartz sands revealed that the ratio of suspended load to bedload sediment transport is a function of grain diameter and shear stress at the sediment surface. Data collected from the ASSET Flume were used to formulate a novel empirical relation for predicting the ratio of bedload to suspended load as a function of shear stress and grain diameter for noncohesive sediments.},

While efforts have been made to better understand diffusive fluxes of CH4 in streams, much less attention has been paid to ebullitive fluxes. We examine the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of CH4 ebullition from four lowland headwater streams in the temperate northeastern United States over a 2-yr period. Ebullition was observed in all monitored streams with an overall mean rate of 1.00 {$\pm$} 0.23 mmol CH4 m-2 d-1, ranging from 0.01 to 1.79 to mmol CH4 m-2 d-1 across streams. At biweekly timescales, rates of ebullition tended to increase with temperature. We observed a high degree of spatial heterogeneity in CH4 ebullition within and across streams. Yet, catchment land use was not a simple predictor of this heterogeneity, and instead patches scale variability weakly explained by water depth and sediment organic matter content and quality. Overall, our results support the prevalence of CH4 ebullition from streams and high levels of variability characteristic of this process. Our findings also highlight the need for robust temporal and spatial sampling of ebullition in lotic ecosystems to account for this high level of heterogeneity, where multiple sampling locations and times are necessary to accurately represent the mean rate of flux in a stream. The heterogeneity observed likely indicates a complex set of drivers affect CH4 ebullition from streams which must be considered when upscaling site measurements to larger spatial scales.},

To evaluate the dependencies between available calibration data and model predictions, investigations were conducted based on a 536 km free-flowing reach of the German part of the River Elbe. Five extensive flow-time-related longitudinal surveys with 14 sampling locations were used. The multi-objective calibration of the deterministic river water quality model QSIM was carried out with the nonlinear parameter estimator PEST. At the investigated river reach, parameter sensitivities were highly variable depending mainly on the growth of algal biomass. Based on 30 multi-objective calibration runs considering different numbers and combinations of the data sets, we found that calibration was only slightly improved using more than three data sets. Uncertainties can be decreased by increasing the amount of calibration data. For the calibration data sets, the cumulative distribution functions of the Nash and Sutcliffe coefficient steepen progressively and the uncertainties of model parameters decreased with an increased number of data sets included in the calibration procedure. Also the combination of different calibration data sets had an effect on the goodness of the model validation. Most uncertainties were associated with the calculation of oxygen. These findings are restricted to cases where data sets of different conditions are available. The suggested methodology for model calibration including a cross validation is especially suited for cases where available data are limited, which is common for river water quality modelling investigations. The results of this study will help model users to define appropriate data collections and monitoring schemes.},

Previous research has suggested that as turbidity increases, fish may increase their mobility to counteract the reduction in low visual acuity and maintain prey consumption similar to those in clear water. However, other studies have reported negative and non-significant relationships between turbidity and fish mobility. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of turbidity on fish mobility. We analysed potential sources of variation in the turbidity{\textendash}fish mobility relationships (moderators), such as body size, eye size and the trophic position of fish, as well as turbidity type, range and ecosystem types, while also accounting for phylogenetic relationships among fish species. Our results revealed that the overall effect size of turbidity on fish mobility was not significantly different from zero, indicating that turbidity does not consistently affect fish mobility. Instead, some fish species may increase their mobility, while others decrease or remain unchanged. Furthermore, the effects of turbidity on fish mobility varied greatly among studies. However, none of the moderators tested explained~such variability in the turbidity{\textendash}fish mobility relationships. These findings demonstrate that the effects of turbidity on fish movements are complex and that some fish species and populations may be particularly vulnerable to increasing turbidity levels in water bodies worldwide caused by human activities.},

Matrices having this property are exhibited for the equations of steady and unsteady gasdynamics. In order to construct thems it is found helpful to introduce ``parameter vectors'' which notably simplify the structure of the conservation laws.}

Rock and sand colonization and biofilm formation was intensively studied for 44 d at two stream reaches: control and experimental (continuous addition of phosphate, ammonia, and nitrate). Structural (C, N, and polysaccharide content and bacterial and chlorophyll density) and metabolic biofilm parameters (beta-glucosidase, peptidase, and phosphatase enzyme activities) were analyzed throughout the colonization process. The epilithic biofilm (grown on rocks) had a higher peptidase activity at the impacted reach, together with a higher algal and bacterial biomass. The positive relationship between the peptidase activity per cell and the N content of the epilithic biofilm suggested that heterotrophic utilization of proteinaceous compounds from within the biofilm was occurring. In contrast, nutrient addition caused the epipsammic biofilm (grown on sand) to exhibit lower beta-glucosidase and phosphatase activities, without a significant increase in bacterial and algal biomass. The differential response to nutrient addition was related to different structural characteristics within each biofilm. The epipsammic biofilm had a constant and high C:N ratio (22.7) throughout the colonization. The epilithic biofilm had a higher C:N ratio at the beginning of the colonization (43.2) and evolved toward a more complex structure (high polysaccharide content and low C:N ratio) during later stages. The epipsammic biofilm was a site for the accumulation and degradation of organic matter: polysaccharides and organic phosphorus compounds had higher degradation activities.}

For this purpose, a set of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images were processed to generate three different land use maps for 1987, 2002, and 2011. The images were corrected for geometric distortion and atmospheric interference before performing an unsupervised classification and decision expert system post classification. The land use maps for 1987 and 2002, derived from the Landsat TM processing, were analyzed using a Land Change Modeler (LCM) module to identify transitions from the first land cover type to the second. The transitions were modeled using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network to create transition potential maps, which provide the controls for subsequent dynamic land use change predictions. The model produced a predicted land use map for 2011 using Markov Chain analysis, which was validated with the actual 2011 land use map. Consequently, a land use scenario (S1) for 2035 and 2050 was predicted, taking into account the current constraints and management options. LCM was further used to define two additional scenarios (S2 and S3) both for 2035 and 2050 based on different land management options.},

While several domain adaptation approaches have been proposed to overcome such domain shifts, their application is limited if the fault classes represented in the two domains are not the same. To enable a better transferability between two different domains, particularly in setups where only the healthy data class is shared between the two domains, we propose a new framework for Partial and Open-Partial domain adaptation based on generating distinct fault signatures with a Wasserstein GAN. The main contribution of the proposed framework is the controlled data generation with two characteristics. Firstly, previously unobserved target faults can be generated by having only access to healthy target and faulty source samples. Secondly, distinct fault types and severity levels can be generated precisely. The proposed method is especially suited for extreme domain adaption settings that are particularly relevant in the context of complex and safety-critical systems, where only one class is shared between the two domains. We evaluate the proposed framework on Partial as well as Open-Partial domain adaptation tasks on two bearing fault diagnostics case studies. In the evaluated case studies the proposed methodology demonstrated superior results compared to other methods, particularly in the presence of large domain gaps. The experiments conducted in different label space settings (Partial and Open-Partial) showcase the versatility of the proposed framework.},

The sediment yield data set includes records from semi-natural catchments in northern Italy as well as agricultural and seminatural basins in central and southern Italy. The average size of the catchments is 150 km2 with mean annual sediment yields ranging from 0.20 to 20 t ha{\`A}1 year{\`A}1. WaTEM/SEDEM estimates mean annual sediment fluxes to permanent river channels. Depending on the local transport capacity, the sediment flux is detachment-limited or transport-limited. The optimal transport capacity parameters for Italian conditions were derived via automatic calibration procedures. A global model calibration procedure taking into account all catchments in the dataset led to an overestimation of the sediment yield for the mountain catchments and an underestimation for the non-mountain catchments. Sediment yield estimates are more reliable when calibration procedures are applied separately for mountain and non-mountain catchments. The model performance of WaTEM/ SEDEM is rather poor in the mountain catchments (R=0.25), which suggests that the model structure is too simplified to come to an adequate description of the sediment fluxes. The model performance for the non-mountain catchments, which are more important from a management point of view, is significantly better (R=0.51). Considering the fact that data layers with a 75{\^A}75 m resolution were used, the results are encouraging the further development and application of spatially distributed sediment yield models at regional and national scale levels.},

  abstract = {A one spatial-box version of the NEMURO oceanic lower trophic food web model was applied to a coastal upwelling environment typified by West Coast Vancouver Island. We used both ad hoc calibration and the automatic calibration program PEST. NEMURO was first calibrated to 1 year of monthly field data using the usual ad hoc approach of trial and error changes to 18 candidate parameters. Four PEST calibrations were then performed. The first three PEST calibrations used model predictions in year 10 from the ad hoc calibration as data in a twin experiment design; the fourth PEST calibration repeated the ad hoc procedure by having PEST calibrate NEMURO to the field data. When provided with ad hoc calibration model predictions as data, PEST accurately recovered the known 18 parameter values, even when small and large phytoplankton were lumped into total phytoplankton. When 57 parameters were allowed to vary PEST-estimated reasonable values for all 57 parameters, but they differed from the ad hoc calibrated values. However, when applied to the field data, PEST-estimated parameter values that differed greatly from the ad hoc values. The PEST calibration fitted some of the field data better than the ad hoc calibration but at the cost of unequal small and large phytoplankton concentrations. Thus, with proper and careful implementation, PEST offers a viable approach for objective calibration of NEMURO to sitespecific monitoring data. We recommend that automatic calibration methods, such as PEST, be used for application of the NEMURO model to new locations. When the field data allow for specification of time series for each phytoplankton and zooplankton state variable, PEST will provide an objective, defensible, and repeatable way to calibrate the many parameters of the NEMURO model. If the available data are insufficient for specification of each state variable, then ad hoc calibration will likely be needed to allow for inclusion of qualitative decisions about model fit. Use of PEST in this situation will provide better understanding of the data-model mis-matches and will provide an alternative calibration to the necessary, but subjective, ad hoc calibration. Comparison of the ad hoc and PEST calibrations (even if unsuccessful) will help in the interpretation of the ad hoc calibration. Robust parameter estimation by any method depends on the quality and consistency of the calibration dataset. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper describes morphologically similar stream reaches that are divided into 7 major stream type categories that differ in entrenchment, gradient, width/depth ratio, and sinuosity in various landforms. Within each major category are six additional types delineated by dominate channel materials from bedrock to silt/clay along a continuum of gradient ranges. Recent stream type data used to further define classification interrelationships were derived from 450 rivers throughout the U.S, Canada, and New Zealand. Data used in the development of this classification involved a great diversity of hydro-physiographic/geomorphic provinces from small to large rivers and in catchments from headwater streams in the mountains to the coastal plains. A stream hierarchical inventory system is presented which utilizes the stream classification system. Examples for use of this stream classification system for engineering, fish habitat enhancement, restoration and water resource management applications are presented. Specific examples of these applications include hydraulic geometry relations, sediment supply/availability, fish habitat structure evaluation, flow resistance, critical shear stress estimates, shear stress/velocity relations, streambank erodibility potential, management interpretations, sequences of morphological evolution, and river restoration principles.},

For almost 50 years, we have been able to remotely sense key water quality constituents like total suspended sediment, dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll a, and Secchi disk depth. Nonetheless, remote sensing of water quality is poorly integrated into inland water sciences, in part due to a lack of publicly available training data and a perception that remote estimates are unreliable. Remote sensing models of water quality can be improved by training and validation on larger data sets of coincident field and satellite observations, here called matchups. To facilitate model development and deeper integration of remote sensing into inland water science, we have built AquaSat, the largest such matchup data set ever assembled. AquaSat contains more than 600,000 matchups, covering 1984{\textendash}2019, of ground-based total suspended sediment, dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll a, and SDDSecchi disk depth measurements paired with spectral reflectance from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 collected within {$\pm$}1 day of each other. To build AquaSat, we developed open source tools in R and Python and applied them to existing public data sets covering the contiguous United States, including the Water Quality Portal, LAGOS-NE, and the Landsat archive. In addition to publishing the data set, we are also publishing our full code architecture to facilitate expanding and improving AquaSat. We anticipate that this work will help make remote sensing of inland water accessible to more hydrologists, ecologists, and limnologists while facilitating novel data-driven approaches to monitoring and understanding critical water resources at large spatiotemporal scales.},

  abstract = {Morphodynamic models are used by river practitioners and scientists to simulate geomorphic change in natural and artificial river channels. It has long been recognized that these models are sensitive to the choice of parameter values, and proper calibration is now common practice. This paper investigates the less recognized impact of the choice of the model itself. All morphodynamic models purport to simulate the same flow and sediment dynamics, often relying on the same governing equations. Yet in solving these equations, the models have different underlying assumptions, for example regarding spatial discretization, turbulence, sediment inflow, lateral friction, and bed load transport. These differences are not always considered by the average model user, who might expect similar predictions from calibrated models. Here, a series of numerical simulations in meandering channels was undertaken to test whether six morphodynamic codes (BASEMENT, CCHE-2D, NAYS, SSIIM-1, TELEMAC-2D and TELEMAC3D) would yield significantly different equilibrium bathymetries if subjected to identical, initial flow conditions. We found that, despite producing moderately similar velocity patterns on a fixed-flat bed (regression coefficient r of 0.77 {$\pm$} 0.20), the codes disagree substantially with respect to simulated bathymetries (r = 0.49 {$\pm$} 0.31). We relate these discrepancies to differences in the codes' assumptions. Results were configuration specific, i.e. codes that perform well for a given channel configuration do not necessarily perform well with higher or lower sinuosity configurations. Finally, limited correlation is found between accuracy and code complexity; the inclusion of algorithms that explicitly account for the effects of local bed slope and channel curvature effects on transport magnitude and direction does not guarantee accuracy. The range of solutions obtained from the evaluated codes emphasizes the need for carefully considering the choice of code. We recommend the creation of a central repository providing universal validation cases and documentation of recognized fluvial codes in commonly studied fluvial settings.

  abstract = {Meandering river channels are often associated with cohesive banks. Yet only a few river modelling packages include geotechnical and plant effects. Existing packages are solely compatible with single-threaded channels, require a specific mesh structure, derive lateral migration rates from hydraulic properties, determine stability based on friction angle, rely on nonphysical assumptions to describe cutoffs, or exclude floodplain processes and vegetation. In this paper, we evaluate the accuracy of a new geotechnical module that was developed and coupled with Telemac-Mascaret to address these limitations. Innovatively, the newly developed module relies on a fully configurable, universal genetic algorithm with tournament selection that permits it (1) to assess geotechnical stability along potentially unstable slope profiles intersecting liquid-solid boundaries, and (2) to predict the shape and extent of slump blocks while considering mechanical plant effects, bank hydrology, and the hydrostatic pressure caused by flow. The profiles of unstable banks are altered while ensuring mass conservation. Importantly, the new stability module is independent of mesh structure and can operate efficiently along multithreaded channels, cutoffs, and islands. Data collected along a 1.5-km-long reach of the semialluvial Medway Creek, Canada, over a period of 3.5 years are used to evaluate the capacity of the coupled model to accurately predict bank retreat in meandering river channels and to evaluate the extent to which the new model can be applied to a natural river reach located in a complex environment. Our results indicate that key geotechnical parameters can indeed be adjusted to fit observations, even with a minimal calibration effort, and that the model correctly identifies the location of the most severely eroded bank regions. The combined use of genetic and spatial analysis algorithms, in particular for the evaluation of geotechnical stability independently of the hydrodynamic mesh, permits the consideration of biophysical conditions for an extended river reach with complex bank geometries, with only a minor increase in run time. Further improvements with respect to plant representation could assist scientists in better understanding channel-floodplain interactions and in evaluating channel designs in river management projects.},

  abstract = {This study investigates changes in erosion rates at high temporal and spatial resolution for three example catchments in West, North and East Saxony/Germany under climate change. The study is based on the A1B IPCC-scenario and model outputs of four models: ECHAM5-OPYC3 (general circulation model), WETTREG2010 (statistical downscaling climate model), METVER (agricultural model for calculation of daily initial soil moisture) and EROSION 3D as a process-based soil erosion model. Simulations were run for measured and projected single rainstorm events at a temporal resolution of 5min. Soil loss was simulated for two future periods from 2041 to 2050 and 2091 to 2100, respectively. Results were compared to simulated soil loss based on 10years of measured climate data from 1989 to 2007. Expected changes in land use, soil management due to changed crop rotation and shifted harvest date are taken into account as scenario studies. Outputs of the regional climate model show that the total number of rainstorms with intensities{$\geq$}0.1mm/min is decreasing in future while rainfall intensities are increasing. Periods of heavy rainstorms will mostly shift from summer to autumn. While the total amount of annual rainfall is decreasing and the duration of sunshine is strongly increasing, soils become drier. Dry periods will appear more often in late autumn. Results of the simulations with EROSION 3D quantify the impacts of climate change on erosion rates. Climate change will lead to a significant increase of soil loss by 2050 and a partial decrease by 2100. Not adapting soil management and land use will aggravate erosion rates. The impacts of land use, soil management and soil properties on soil erosion by water are higher than the effects of changed precipitation patterns. Current soil protection measures are suitable for soil conservation under conditions of a changed climate.},

  abstract = {Suspended sediment dynamics are still imperfectly understood, especially in areas of Mediterranean climate with strong seasonal contrasts, where few studies have been conducted. The aim of this study is to analyze the variability in the suspended sediment load at different temporal scales (within-flood variability, monthly-seasonal and annual) in the Tordera River (894~km2), located in northeastern Spain. Suspended sediment samples were obtained during base flows (Q{$\leq$}3.5~m3 s-1) and flood events (Q{$>$}3.5~m3 s-1). The analysis of the variability in the suspended sediment is structured in two consecutive steps: (i) the construction of statistical relations between suspended sediment concentrations (C) and discharge (Q) and (ii) the application of those relations to assess the suspended sediment yield. The results show that, in a single event, the sediment peak generally precedes the peak discharge, following a clockwise hysteretic loop. Furthermore, it was observed that the reduction in the suspended sediment concentrations in a sequence of events can be mainly associated with a phenomenon of sediment exhaustion. The total amount of suspended sediment transported during a single flood is thus related to its duration and time (during the year) as well as to its magnitude. At a seasonal scale, the export of suspended sediment takes place in two phases: (i) sediment preparation and, (ii) sediment transfer and exhaustion. During the latter phase, the exhaustion of the sediment load is primarily related to the sequence of flood events. At the annual scale, the results show high inter-annual variability according to the number of floods recorded yearly, since almost all the suspended load is transported during those events.},

  abstract = {Background, Aim and Scope. Past and present management of the Ebro catchment have altered water, sediment and nutrient fluxes of the lower Ebro River and its delta. The construction of the Mequinensa and Riba-Roja dams during the 1960s disrupted the sediment transport continuity. As a result, the lower Ebro River and its delta are facing a reduction in sediment delivery which is estimated to be up to 99\% of its original yield (about 3 x 10(7) t/yr). Consequently, about 45\% of the emerged delta will be under the mean sea level by 2100 due to subsidence and sea level rise, whereas the delta coast is retreating at a rate of several meters per year in the mouth area. This paper aims to establish the basis for a sediment management plan directed to offset the effects of the sediment delivery deficit of the Ebro delta. Main Features. A new management plan named 'Integrated Plan for the Protection of the Ebro Delta' (PIPDE) is being presently elaborated in order to develop sustainable management of the Ebro River and delta through an integrated management of water, sediment and habitats, in order to achieve European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD) requirements. Among other aspects, the plan aims to restore the sediment flux of the lower Ebro River by means of both the removal of the sediment trapped behind the dams and the transport of the sediment downstream of the reservoirs to the river mouth and delta plain. Results. Preliminary studies show that the 'flushing flood' method has lower costs and is the most adapted method to transfer the sediments retained into the Riba-Roja dam. The required sediment load to stop coastal retreat in the mouth area and to compensate relative sea level rise represents 10 times the present suspended load (0.021 g/l), but is 10 times lower than the total volume of sediment delivered to the sea under natural conditions. Sediment delivery to the delta plain can be accomplished through the rice irrigation system, a method used prior to dam construction. Discussion. Problems of achieving a sustainable management of water and sediment are mostly linked to reservoir management. Technical problems associated with by-passing sediments through the reservoirs can be solved through operational and structural changes. Benefits of sediment flow recovery are multiple, including maintenance of the reservoir capacity, possible decline of invasive species, reduction of elevation loss and coastal retreat in the delta. Conclusions. The partial restoration of sediment fluxes in the lower Ebro River and its delta is technically feasible and environmentally desirable, but further detailed studies need to be carried out before the plan can be implemented. Perspectives. Overall, the sustainability of the lower Ebro River and delta can only be guaranteed by the implementation of a new reservoir management concept where the ecological and morphological values, as well as the economical and social values, have to be taken into consideration.}

Twenty-nine different initially aversive activities are shown to produce pleasure (hedonic reversals) in substantial numbers of individuals from both college student and Mechanical Turk samples. Hedonic reversals group, by factor analysis, into sadness, oral irritation, fear, physical activity/exhaustion, pain, strong alcohol-related tastes, bitter tastes, and disgust. Liking for sad experiences (music, novels, movies, paintings) forms a coherent entity, and is related to enjoyment of crying in response to sad movies. For fear and oral irritation, individuals also enjoy the body's defensive reactions. Enjoyment of sadness is higher in females across domains. We explain these findings in terms of benign masochism, enjoyment of negative bodily reactions and feelings in the context of feeling safe, or pleasure at ``mind over body''. In accordance with benign masochism, for many people, the favored level of initially negative experiences is just below the level that cannot be tolerated.

  abstract = {An important source of uncertainty affecting the results of 3-D hydrodynamic models of wind-driven lakes, and one which is rarely formally addressed, arises in the development of spatially and temporally varying wind fields used as surface boundary conditions. We analyze one of the sources of uncertainty in this process and propose a simple and straightforward method to assess the uncertainty in model results arising from the construction of wind fields for surface boundary conditions. Taking into account such uncertainty in model results, it is demonstrated that a 3-D hydrodynamic model is able to represent mathematically the evolution of the stratification in a large wind-driven lake. Using the Salton Sea as a case study, and taking model uncertainty into consideration, we demonstrate that a reduction of the lake size, as has been proposed for restoration of the Salton Sea, will induce a stronger and more persistent stratification. These changes in stratification are shown to be statistically significant. As the number of weather stations used to reconstruct the wind field over water increases from three to five, agreement between field and simulated data improves, possibly because of reduced uncertainty in the spatial interpolation of wind data. Differences in stratification between the Salton Sea as it currently exists and as it could exist if restoration plans are implemented, with the lake occupying the northern end of the basin and its surface area reduced by 80\%, are the result of the spatial variability of the wind and changes in the magnitude of the wind-driven mechanical energy fluxes into the lake.},

  abstract = {Dams fragment river systems worldwide, and Mediterranean-climate rivers, characterised by highly seasonal hydrographs and adapted biotas, are particularly impacted by flow regulation. Whereas the effects of flow regulation on hydrology, sediment transport and biodiversity have long been examined, responses at the food-web level remain understudied. Environmental variation is a key control of food-web structure. Thus, we predicted that flow regulation would impact food-chain length (FCL) via changes in the flow variation regime, and we tested this prediction in a set of flow unregulated to completely regulated reaches in a Mediterranean river basin. In each reach, we characterised flow variation, together with two other putative controls of FCL (productivity and habitat size). We combined community data with carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to estimate food-chain length, and Bayesian mixing models allowed estimates of dietary proportions of consumers. Flow variation was paramount in controlling FCL in the studied river network, and this same control largely explained the degree of omnivory among top predators. Thus, omnivory mechanisms were the main proximate structural mechanism allowing shifts in food-web structure and linking disturbance regimes to FCL. Our results suggest that flow regulation in Mediterranean rivers may impact food-web structure even when no significant changes in community composition are observed. If highly variable Mediterranean streams become increasingly affected by flow regulation, the resulting more stable conditions could enhance intraguild predation and thus lengthen riverine food chains.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional numerical model was used for calculating the velocity and bed level changes over time in a 90{\textdegree} bended channel. The numerical model solved the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations in three dimensions to compute the water flow and used the finite-volume method as the discretization scheme. The k-␧ model predicted the turbulence, and the SIMPLE method computed the pressure. The suspended sediment transport was calculated by solving the convection diffusion equation and the bed load transport quantity was determined with an empirical formula. The model was enhanced with relations for the movement of sediment particles on steep side slopes in river bends. Located on a transversally sloping bed, a sediment particle has a lower critical shear stress than on a flat bed. Also, the direction of its movement deviates from the direction of the shear stress near the bed. These phenomenona are considered to play an important role in the morphodynamic process in sharp channel bends. The calculated velocities as well as the bed changes over time were compared with data from a physical model study and good agreement was found.},

  abstract = {The present study investigated the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in predicting the formation, development, and migration of free-forming meander bends. The three-dimensional CFD model computed water flow and sediment transport in alluvial channels and predicted vertical and horizontal bed changes. Different algorithms and parameters were tested to provide an insight into the application range of CFD when modelling free-forming meander formation. The computational domain was discretized by an unstructured grid. A control volume method was used for the discretization of the Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations for the flow calculation and of the convection{\textendash}diffusion equation for the sediment transport calculation. Turbulence was modelled by the k{\textendash}{$\epsilon$} turbulence model. The simulation was started from an initially straight grid, with neither sediment feed nor any perturbation at the inflow boundary. The model computed the river bed evolution over a real time period of 3 d. Results were compared with laboratory experiments and showed that the CFD model can predict many of the characteristics of the alluvial meander formation and migration. However, some limitations and uncertainties exist that have to be clarified in future investigations.},

The SSC are displayed over time and compared with the evolution of the water level during the same time interval. The present study shows that it is possible to have continuous measurements of SSC and water level with a horizontally installed two beam equipped ADCP and discusses the potential of such a continuing times series measurement for application in hydraulic engineering and research. However, the presented data set shows also that the calibration and the filtering of the raw data has to be improved and that further investigations are needed.

  abstract = {Differences in the transport rate and size of bedload exist for varying levels of flow in coarse-grained channels. For gravel-bed rivers, at least two phases of bedload transport, with notably differing qualities, have been described in the literature. Phase I consists primarily of sand and small gravel moving at relatively low rates over a stable channel surface. Transport rates during Phase II are considerably greater than Phase I and more coarse grains are moved, including material from both the channel surface and subsurface. Transition from Phase I to Phase II indicates initiation and transport of grains comprising the coarse surface layer common in steep mountain channels. While the existence of different phases of transport is generally acknowledged, the threshold between them is often poorly defined. We present the results of the application of a piecewise regression analysis to data on bedload transport collected at 12 gravel-bed channels in Colorado and Wyoming, USA. The piecewise regression recognizes the existence of different linear relationships over different ranges of discharge. The inflection, where the fitted functions intersect, is interpreted as the point of transition from Phase I to Phase II transport; this is termed breakpoint. A comparison of grain sizes moved during the two phases shows that coarse gravel is rarely trapped in the samplers during Phase I transport, indicating negligible movement of grains in this size range. Gravel larger than about D16 of the channel surface is more consistently trapped during Phase II transport. The persistence of coarse gravel in bedload samples provides good evidence that conditions suitable for coarse grain transport have been reached, even though the size of the sediment approaches the size limits of the sampler (76 mm in all cases). A relative breakpoint (Rbr) was defined by the ratio between the discharge at the breakpoint and the 1{$\cdot$}5-year flow (a surrogate for bankfull discharge) expressed as a percentage. The median value of Rbr was about 80 percent, suggesting that Phase II begins at about 80 percent of the bankfull discharge, though the observed values of Rbr ranged from about 60 to 100 percent. Variation in this value appears to be independent of drainage area, median grain size, sorting of bed materials, and channel gradient, at least for the range of parameters measured in 12 gravel-bed channels.

  abstract = {Since the early 1990s, US Forest Service researchers have made thousands of bedload measurements in steep, coarse-grained channels in Colorado and Wyoming, USA. In this paper we use data from 19 of those sites to characterize patterns and rates of coarse sediment transport for a range of channel types and sizes, including step{\textendash}pool, plane-bed, pool{\textendash}riffle, and near-braided channels. This effort builds upon previous work where we applied a piecewise regression model to (1) relate flow to rates of bedload transport and (2) define phases of transport in coarse-grained channels. Earlier, the model was tested using bedload data from eight sites on the Fraser Experimental Forest near Fraser, Colorado. The analysis showed good application to those data and to data from four supplementary channels to which the procedure was applied. The earlier results were, however, derived from data collected at sites that, for the most part, have quite similar geology and runoff regimes. In this paper we evaluate further the application of piecewise regression to data from channels with a wider range of geomorphic conditions. The results corroborate with those from the earlier work in that there is a relatively narrow range of discharges at which a substantial change in the nature of bedload transport occurs. The transition from primarily low rates of sand transport (phase I) to higher rates of sand and coarse gravel transport (phase II) occurs, on average, at about 80 per cent of the bankfull (1{$\cdot$}5-year return interval) discharge. A comparison of grain sizes moved during the two phases showed that coarse gravel is rarely trapped in the samplers during phase I transport. Moreover, the movement and capture of the D16 to D25 grain size of the bed surface seems to correspond with the onset of phase II transport, particularly in systems with largely static channel surfaces. However, while there were many similarities in observed patterns of bedload transport at the 19 studied sites, each had its own `bedload signal' in that the rate and size of materials transported largely reflected the nature of flow and sediment particular to that system.

For this purpose, a fully three-dimensional numerical model is used to investigate the efficiency of different flushing scenarios. The applied numerical program SSIIM 2 solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations accordingly to the finite volume method and with a k-{$\epsilon$} turbulence closure for an adaptive, unstructured and non-orthogonal grid. The suspended sediment transport is calculated by solving the transient convection-diffusion equations for multiple grain sizes. The model is set up based on bathymetric data, sediment characteristics from bed samples, the initial thickness of the deposited sediments and the in- and outflow discharge rates. In order to investigate the success of reservoir flushing, three scenarios with different water levels are simulated. The simulated bed level changes, as well as the calculated amount of flushed out sediments, are presented in this study. The results reflect the dependency on the success of the flushing on the lowering target.},

Intensive abstraction and regulation cause river ecosystems to shift towards non-natural flow regimes, which might have implications for their water quality, biological structure and functioning. We performed a meta-analysis of published studies to assess the potential effects of water stress on nutrients, microcontaminants, biological communities (bacteria, algae, invertebrates and fish), and ecosystem functions (organic matter breakdown, gross primary production and respiration). Despite the different nature of the flow regime changes, our meta-analysis showed significant effects of human-driven water stress, such as significant increases in algal biomass and metabolism and reduced invertebrate richness, abundance and density and organic matter decomposition. Water stress also significantly decreased phosphate concentration and increased the concentration of pharmaceutical compounds. The magnitude of significant effects was dependent on climate, rainfall regime, period of the year, river size and type of water stress. Among the different causes of water stress, flow regulation by dams produced the strongest effects, followed by water abstraction and channelization.},

The neuro-fuzzy system is used to provide a nonlinear regression between the deviatoric stress and axial strain ({$\sigma$}d {\`A} {$\epsilon$}) obtained from a consolidated drained triaxial test on samples of poorly graded sand. The soil model parameters are determined in an iterative optimization loop with PSO and an adaptive network based on a fuzzy inference system such that the equations of the linear elastic model and (where appropriate) the hardening Drucker-Prager yield criterion are simultaneously satisfied. It is shown that the model parameters can be determined with relatively high accuracy in spite of the limited insight gained by a single set of data. To verify the robustness of the technique, a second set of data obtained under different confining pressures is then used in a separate run.

  abstract = {Many power plants require large quantities of water for cooling purposes. The water taken from the source water body (e.g., lakes, estuaries, bays and rivers) circulates through the plant and returns to the source through outfall with a higher temperature. For optimal performance of the power plant, the intake inlet and discharge outlet should be meticulously placed so that the heated water will not recirculate back into the power plant. In this study, the Flow module of the Delft3D software is employed to simulate the temperature transport within the study area in three-dimensional and nested format. Model results are used to optimize the location of intake inlets, outfall outlets and diffuser port orientations. The physical processes used in the study are tidal fluctuations, winds, river discharges, salinity and temperature. The subject power plant (power plant parameters presented in this paper are realistic; however, they do not target any specific power plant within the study area) has a nominal capacity of 2600 MW and is planned to be located in Delaware Bay, USA. Existing field measurements are used to calibrate the model in a coupled two-staged fashion for main tidal constituents, currents and water temperature. The sensitivity of the model against various input parameters is tested, and conservative values are selected. The location of the intake is fixed, and the location of the outfall is changed until the thermal impact to the intake is less than 1 {\textdegree}C. Analysis of the results shows that there is a linear logarithmic relation between the excess temperatures at the intake inlet and horizontal eddy diffusivity. The     k - {$\epsilon$}     turbulence closure results in higher excess temperature and a more conservative design. Extending the outfall location to the deeper portion of the estuary combined with port orientations reduces the impact by keeping the thermal plume away from the intake inlet and meeting the established criteria. It is concluded that an approximate distance of 1300 m is the optimal location for the power plant outfall outlets. In addition, the diffuser ports should not discharge the heated water toward the intake and have to be oriented away from the line connecting outfall to the intake.},

To achieve this, continued investment will be required across a range of sustainable technologies. Hydropower has a long history in Scotland and the present-day operational capacity of {\textasciitilde}1.5GW already makes a substantial contribution to the national energy budget. In addition, there remains potential for {\textasciitilde}500MW of further development, mostly in the form of small to medium size run-of-river schemes. Climate change is expected to lead to an intensification of the global hydrological cycle, leading to changes in both the magnitude and seasonality of river flows. There may also be indirect effects on water flows, such as changing land use, enhanced evapotranspiration rates and an increased demand for irrigation, all of which could affect the water available for energy generation. In this paper we describe Scotland׳s currently installed hydropower capacity and present a review of the scope for future development. We also review the potential impacts of climate change, highlighting possible adaptation measures as well as key factors likely to determine financial viability over the coming decades. We present a summary of the present state of knowledge regarding the resilience of Scotland׳s hydropower resource to a changing climate, and identify key areas where further research is required.},

In particular, cross-sectional secondary currents develop significantly associated with an interaction between meandering inbank main-channel flow and straight overbank floodplain flow. These currents promote mass and momentum exchanges between them, as well as sediment transport and bed erosion. Further, organized motions may be generated in the same manner as typical horizontal vortices in straight compound channels. However, there is limited detailed information on the generation process of organized motion and secondary currents. This study focuses on the 3D structure of horizontal coherent motion and its advection property in the channel-transition zone from the straight to meandering compound open-channel flows by using a multi-layer scanning PIV, and compares them with those of continuous meandering channel flows. A strong relation between the horizontal vortices and secondary currents was obtained, resulting in a phenomenological flow model.},

Bend apex being the section of maximum curvature in a meandering channel, the longitudinal velocity remains higher on the inner wall as compared to the outer wall in a meandering channel.

The methodology is first developed for single-level models, and then extended to systems that are studied using multi-level models that interact with each other. Two types of interactions amongst multilevel models are considered: (1) Type-I, where the output of a lower-level model (component and/or subsystem) becomes an input to a higher level system model, and (2) Type-II, where parameters of the system model are inferred using lower-level models and tests (that describe simplified components and/ or isolated physics). The various models, their inputs, parameters, and outputs, experimental data, and various sources of model error are connected through a Bayesian network. The results of calibration, verification, and validation with respect to each individual model are integrated using the principles of conditional probability and total probability, and propagated through the Bayesian network in order to quantify the overall system-level prediction uncertainty. The proposed methodology is illustrated with numerical examples that deal with heat conduction and structural dynamics.},

  abstract = {River bank erosion is a destructive fluvio-hydrological hazard particularly inhabited flood plain of the dynamic Himalayan foreland basin. Every year during monsoonal months, morphology of the landscape is continuously modifying through the dynamic river system. The principal objectives of this study are (i) to identify the river bank erosion susceptibility through BESI (River Bank Susceptibility Index) model which has been modified from Rosgen's (2001) Bank Erosion Hazard Index (BEHI) model and historical reconstruction (from 1955 to 2021) of the river course of Mujnai and (ii) to examine the principal factors of river bank erosion particularly for the river Mujnai within Himalayan Foreland Basin. Sedimentary bank facies analysis has also been done to ascertain the causes of river bank instability. Hence, rate of bank migration, changes of channel width, channel sinuosity index (SI), channel length, erosion and accretion of the river bank, and so forth have been measured through geospatial techniques. Result showed that the younger Quaternary sediments are prone to erosion and BESI result illustrated that around 28\% areas are under high erosion zones like Deoagaon, Dhulagaon, Hedayet Nagar, and Dalimpur villages in Alipurduar district. Average maximum width of the channel was recorded in 1980 (147.92 m). Additionally, the lateral migration in case of left bank was around 141.08 m (in the 1980) and 192.62 m in right bank (in 1980) while the shifting rate was 14.10 m/y and 17.51 m/y respectively. Quaternary bank materials, bioturbation and indistinct laminations of river bank are principal regulating factors behind bank erosion in this area. Monsoonal high-velocity flow, bank full discharge and severe flood incidents accelerate the bank erosion vulnerability, particularly in this dynamic flood plain. Soft engineering techniques such as bioengineering, geo-textile fabric, tree, grass and brush revetment should be implemented at high bank erosion vulnerable sites of river Mujnai.},

It is supposed that making slope of outer banks gentler is one of useful measures for mitigating scouring and bank erosion in curved and meandering channels. Therefore flow structures and bed variations around the gently sloped outer banks have to be understood to design slope of outer banks in actual rivers. However most of models proposed in curved channels were applied for the channels having a vertical wall. In this paper, applicability of the quasi-three-dimensional calculation model (the bottom velocity computation (BVC) method) is discussed for the experiments on flows and bed variations in curved channels with gently sloped outer banks (1V:2H and 1V:3H). From the comparison between calculation and experiment results, it is found that the BVC method reproduces vertical distributions of horizontal velocities and scouring depth around the gently sloped outer banks and provides a proper design of curved channels with gently sloped outer banks.},

  abstract = {This study presents the development of a 3D numerical code for flow-sediment interactions with associated bed changes in free surface flows. To capture the water-air interface, a novel volume of fluid (VOF) formulation is implemented using the ghost fluid method with one-side extrapolation for dynamic pressure. Equations for fluid flow and free surface motion are decoupled due to separation of time scales. Accordingly, time step size can be increased by a factor of 3-orders of magnitude and still preserve numerical stability and computational efficiency. A novel finite area method (FAM) is utilized to discretize Exner equation on irregular bed surface providing a 3D finite volume-like discretization on curved surfaces. The evolution of the water-sediment interface is captured by a novel vertex-based unstructured mesh dynamic motion solve using Laplace operator with variable diffusivity. The code is implemented in foam-extend and tested against two classical experiments. Good results are obtained with correct trends and lower absolute error compared to previous mobile bed models. This shows that the developed code has a good potential of being applied to mobile-bed hydraulic real problems.},

It was found that the change in seasonal values of Siberian river discharges is a consequence of an atmospheric climatic shift that occurred in the early 1970s over North Asia. This shift was induced by a change in atmospheric circulation pattern in the Eurasian sector and Pacific sector of the Northern Hemisphere after 1970. It resulted in changes in position and intensity of the Siberian High and Aleutian Low before and after the 1970s, which induced a different pattern of precipitation in West and East Siberia. There was an increase in winter precipitation over West Siberia but a decrease over East Siberia. The period after 1970s is characterized by higher amplitude of all parameters and increases in the year-to-year variability.},

Here we show how social inequalities across different groups or individuals play a major role in the production and manifestation of such crises. Specifically, due to stark socioeconomic inequalities, urban elites are able to overconsume water while excluding less-privileged populations from basic access. Through an interdisciplinary approach, we model the uneven domestic water use across urban spaces and estimate water consumption trends for different social groups. The highly unequal metropolitan area of Cape Town serves as a case in point to illustrate how unsustainable water use by the elite can exacerbate urban water crises at least as much as climate change or population growth.},

Reservoir sedimentation has the potential to affect flood levels, drainage for agricultural land, pump station and hydropower operation as well as navigation. This paper describes the development of a coupled fully three-dimensional (3D) numerical model for the prediction of the local sediment flushing scour upstream of the bottom outlet. The presented numerical model solves the Navier-Stokes equations in conjunction with the k- {$\varepsilon$} turbulence model which includes both sediment transport and hydrodynamic parameters. The proposed coupled fully 3D numerical model is used to simulate experimental tests based on non-cohesive sediment. The geometric features of the scour hole (temporal and spatial hole development) upstream of the bottom outlet were reasonably well predicted compared to the experimental data. Furthermore, the velocity field upstream of the bottom outlet was in good agreement with measurements. The proposed numerical model for bottom outlet flushing was, therefore, validated because of its ability to accurately predict the scour hole development during the flushing process. The proposed numerical model can be considered reliable provided that the model is correctly calibrated and set up to reflect the conditions of a particular case study.},

Flume experiments and numerical simulations show that river water downwells into the riverbed upstream of a channel-spanning log and upwells downstream. Exchange rates are greatest near the log and decay exponentially with distance upstream and downstream. We developed equations for bed pressure profiles and hyporheic exchange rates in the vicinity of a channel-spanning log that can be used to evaluate the impact of LWD removal or reintroduction on hyporheic mixing. The magnitude of pressure disturbance along the bed (and thus hyporheic exchange) increases with the fraction of channel depth blocked by the log and channel Froude number. Exchange rates are relatively insensitive to relative depth of the log (gap ratio). At natural densities, LWD in lowland streams drives reach-averaged hyporheic exchange rates similar to a ripple-covered bed. However, the length scales and residence times of hyporheic exchange due to LWD are greater. By removing LWD from streams, humans have altered patterns and rates of hyporheic exchange, which influence habitat distribution and quality for invertebrates and fish.},

We quantify hyporheic fluid and heat exchange induced by current interaction with channel-spanning logs using two approaches: laboratory flume experiments and numerical simulations that link turbulent open-channel fluid flow, porous fluid flow, and heat transport. Flume and numerical experiments show that logs produce a characteristic diel temperature pattern within sediment that shifts with log blockage ratio (a fraction of the channel depth blocked by the log), channel Froude number, and sediment permeability. Upstream of a log, downwelling water transports the river's diel thermal signal deep into the sediment. Downstream, upwelling water from shallow flow paths has a thermal signal similar to the surface water, while upwelling water from deep flow paths forms a wedge of buffered (low-amplitude) temperatures. Since most hyporheic water emerges from shallow flow paths, upwelling water has limited potential to buffer surface water temperature. Because of historic channel clearing practices, modern rivers have unnaturally low densities of LWD. A key implication is that LWD removal has contributed to thermal homogenization and potential degradation of hyporheic habitats. LWD reintroduction is a promising strategy to improve vertical connectivity in rivers and increase thermal patchiness within the hyporheic zone. However, hyporheic exchange near LWD may not impact diel surface water temperatures at the reach scale.},

To diagnose the flood hazard characteristics, this study analyses the hydrologic sensitivity of flood runoff and inundation to rainfall. The motivation is to address why the seemingly insignificant monsoon rainfall, or 1.2 times more rainfall than for past large floods, including the ones in 1995 and 2006, resulted in such devastating flooding. To quantify the hydrologic sensitivity, this study simulated long-term rainfall{\textendash}runoff and inundation for the entire river basin (160 000 km2). The simulation suggested that the flood inundation volume was 1.6 times more in 2011 than for the past flood events. Furthermore, the elasticity index suggested that a 1 \% increase in rainfall causes a 2.3 \% increase in runoff and a 4.2 \% increase in flood inundation. This study highlights the importance of sensitivity quantification for a better understanding of flood hazard characteristics; the presented basin-wide rainfall{\textendash}runoff{\textendash}inundation simulation was an effective approach to analyse the sensitivity of flood runoff and inundation at the river basin scale.}

The methodology of climate change impact modelling is developed and illustrated through application to a hydropower plant in the Swiss Alps that uses the discharge of a highly glacierised catchment. The potential climate change impacts are analysed in terms of system performance for the control period (1961{\textendash}1990) and for the future period (2070{\textendash}2099) under a range of climate change scenarios. The system performance is simulated through a set of four model types, including the production of regional climate change scenarios based on global-mean warming scenarios, the corresponding discharge model, the model of glacier surface evolution and the hydropower management model. The modelling uncertainties inherent in each model type are characterised and quantified separately. The overall modelling uncertainty is simulated through Monte Carlo simulations of the system behaviour for the control and the future period. The results obtained for both periods lead to the conclusion that potential climate change has a statistically significant negative impact on the system performance.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

There are various mathematical approaches in the scientific literature for computing critical shear stress. However, processes that influence sediment stability are still not fully understood, and available formulas differ considerably. These discrepancies in the literature arise from random system behaviour (natural variability of the sediments), different definitions of the critical shear stress, different measurement techniques and different model frameworks (scope of the parameters, undisturbed versus artificial sediment samples). While analytical approaches fail to address the involved uncertainties, fuzzy logic-based models integrate uncertainty and imprecision.},

Physical model tests were used to explore how the wood position and submergence level (discharge) affect wake structure, and hence the resulting habitat. We observed a von-K{\'a}rm{\'a}n vortex street (VS) for emergent logs placed at the channel center, while no VS formed for submerged logs, because the flow entering the wake from above the log (sweeping flow) inhibited VS formation. As a result, emergent logs placed at the channel center resulted in ten times higher turbulent kinetic energy compared to submerged logs. In addition, both spatial variation in time-mean velocity and turbulence level increased with increasing log length and decreasing submergence level. Submerged logs and logs placed at the channel side created a greater velocity deficit and a longer recirculation zone, both of which can increase the residence time in the wake and deposition of organic matter and nutrients. The results demonstrate that variation in log size and degree of submergence can be used as a tool to vary habitat suitability for different fish preferences. To maximize habitat diversity in rivers, we suggest a diverse large wood placement.},

  abstract = {In forested mountain catchment areas, both bedload and large wood (LW) can be transported during ordinary flows. Retention structures such as sediment traps or racks are built to mitigate potential hazards downstream. Up to now, the design of these retention structures focuses on either LW or bedload. In addition, the majority of LW retention racks tend to retain both LW and bedload, while bedload transport continuity during ordinary flows is an important aspect to be considered in the design. Therefore, a series of flume experiments was conducted to study the effect of LW accumulations at an inclined bar screen with a bottom clearance on backwater rise and bedload transport. The main focus was put on testing different LW characteristics such as LW size, density, fine material, and shape (branches and rootwads), as well as a sequenced flood. The results demonstrated that a few logs (wood volume of {$\approx$} 7 m3 prototype scale with a model scale factor of 30) are sufficient to reduce the bedload transport capacity to below 75\% compared to the condition without LW. Fine material and smaller wood sizes further reduced bedload transport and increased backwater rise. In contrast, LW density and LW shape had a negligible effect. The test focusing on a sequenced flood highlighted the need for maintenance measures to avoid self-flushing of the bed material. The results of this study further indicate that an inclined bar screen may need to be adapted by considering LW characteristics in the design of the bottom clearance to enable bedload continuity during ordinary flows.},

During floods, not only sediment but also large wood (LW) can be transported, that may block the inclined bar screen (mechanical barrier) and inhibit sediment transport. The design of the inclined bar screen has not been tested with LW. We conducted a first set of simplified flume experiments to study the effect of (1) initial conditions, (2) bar screen design, and (3) LW volume on sediment transport. First results demonstrate that a LW volume blocking 20\% of the flow cross-section is sufficient to reduce sediment transport by 50\%. Hence, LW volume is a relevant parameter for the design of inclined bar screens. We provide future research ideas to enable the local separation of LW and sediment.},

Laboratory experiments demonstrated that wood placements can also promote surface declogging, that is, removal of fine sediment from a gravel bed, thereby restoring spawning grounds for fish. Logs of different size and submergence level were placed on a gravel bed clogged with fines. Surface declogging was observed in regions of elevated turbulence in the log wake and elevated velocity adjacent to the log. A criteria for declogging was identified based on a modified non-dimensional Shields parameter combining mean and turbulent velocity at the bed. The footprint of declogged bed scaled with log dimensions. Emergent logs produced a larger declogging footprint compared to submerged logs of the same length, due to their stronger influence on the flow field. Logs were also shown to prevent clogging over similar areas.},

Furthermore, dam reservoirs are used for recreation, navigation and they provide safety in the downstream valleys against extreme flood events and droughts. All reservoirs are subjected to sedimentation which, without adequate prevention and mitigation counter-measures, threatens their sustainability. As well as the evident loss of storage capacity, the adequate and safe operation of water intakes and bottom outlets belonging to the vital outlet structures can be affected by the deposition of sediments in the reservoir. This Vision Paper first addresses the state-of-the-art and the main scientific advances in terms of prevention and mitigation measures against sedimentation in reservoirs.

  abstract = {The characterization of sediment transport is an important problem that has been actively studied for some time. Numerous approaches have been demonstrated in the literature, including mechanistic models, probabilistic arguments, machine learning algorithms, and empirical formulations. Most implementations of sediment transport relations are deterministic in nature and require the specification of model parameters. These parameters are traditionally assumed fixed (i.e.,~a single value), and subsequent predictions are not necessarily representative because of uncertainty because they are fixed (i.e.,~a line). In this paper, a Bayesian statistical sediment transport model is presented, and its ability to infer critical shear values from observations to nonlinear regression is compared. This approach provides several advantages, namely (1)~parameters are not constrained to be normally distributed as is required in many traditional approaches; (2)~estimates of parameter variability are easily obtained and interpreted from distributions that arise naturally from the estimation and prediction process; and (3)~predictive distributions, or probability densities of predictions, are easily obtained through Bayesian methods and provide a robust way to sediment transport probabilistically centered on a deterministic formulation.},

A balance between changes in sediment supply and transport capacity identifies conditions of sediment deficit or surplus. A Shields number represents the competence of postdam flows and the potential for incision under conditions of sediment deficit. A ratio of postdam to predam flood discharge provides a metric for the scale and rate of channel change, especially width. The metrics are calculated for more than 4000 km of some of the major rivers in the western United States. More than 60\% of these rivers are in sediment deficit, and only a few reaches are in sediment surplus. The sediment balance can be used to assess the relative effort involved in reversing undesired conditions of deficit or surplus.},

  abstract = {Soil erodibility, commonly expressed as the K-factor in USLE-type erosion models, is a crucial parameter for determining soil loss rates. However, a national soil erodibility map based on measured soil properties did so far not exist for Switzerland. As an EU non-member state, Switzerland was not included in previous soil mapping programs such as the Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS). However, in 2015 Switzerland joined the LUCAS soil sampling program and extended the topsoil sampling to mountainous regions higher 1500 m asl for the first time in Europe. Based on this soil property dataset we developed a K-factor map for Switzerland to close the gap in soil erodibility mapping in Central Europe. The K-factor calculation is based on a nomograph that relates soil erodibility to data of soil texture, organic matter content, soil structure, and permeability. We used 160 Swiss LUCAS topsoil samples below 1500 m asl and added in an additional campaign 39 samples above 1500 m asl. In order to allow for a smooth interpolation in context of the neighboring regions, additional 1638 LUCAS samples of adjacent countries were considered. Point calculations of K-factors were spatially interpolated by Cubist Regression and Multilevel B-Splines. Environmental features (vegetation index, reflectance data, terrain, and location features) that explain the spatial distribution of soil erodibility were included as covariates. The Cubist Regression approach performed well with an RMSE of 0.0048 t ha h ha{\textendash}1 MJ{\textendash}1 mm{\textendash}1. Mean soil erodibility for Switzerland was calculated as 0.0327 t ha h ha{\textendash}1 MJ{\textendash}1 mm{\textendash}1 with a standard deviation of 0.0044 t ha h ha{\textendash}1 MJ{\textendash}1 mm{\textendash}1. The incorporation of stone cover reduces soil erodibility by 8.2\%. The proposed Swiss erodibility map based on measured soil data including mountain soils was compared to an extrapolated map without measured soil data, the latter overestimating erodibility in mountain regions (by 6.3\%) and underestimating in valleys (by 2.5\%). The K-factor map is of high relevance not only for the soil erosion risk of Switzerland with a particular emphasis on the mountainous regions but also has an intrinsic value of its own for specific land use decisions, soil and land suitability and soil protection.},

The LS-factor was originally developed for slopes less than 50\% inclination and has not been tested for steeper slopes. To overcome this limitation, we adapted both factors slope length L and slope steepness S for conditions experimentally observed at Swiss alpine grasslands. For the new L-factor (Lalpine), a maximal flow path threshold, corresponding to 100 m, was implemented to take into account short runoff flow paths and rapid infiltration that has been observed in our experiments. For the S-factor, a fitted quadratic polynomial function (Salpine) has been established, compiling the most extensive empirical studies. As a model evaluation, uncertainty intervals are presented for this modified Sfactor. We observed that uncertainty increases with slope gradient. In summary, the proposed modification of the LSfactor to alpine environments enables an improved prediction of soil erosion risk including steep slopes.},

In summer, the mean monthly soil loss by water erosion is 48 times higher than the mean soil loss in winter.

  abstract = {Boussinesq's hypothesis is at the heart of eddy viscosity models, which are used in many different fields to model turbulent flows. In its present time formulation, this hypothesis corresponds to an alignment between the Reynolds stress and mean strain tensors. We begin with historical remarks on Boussinesq's results and recall that he introduced a local averaging twenty years before Reynolds, but using an approach that prevented him from discovering Reynolds' stress tensor. We then introduce an indicator that characterizes the validity of this hypothesis. For experimental and numerical databases, when the tensors are known, this can be used to directly estimate the validity of this hypothesis. We show, using several different databases, that this hypothesis is almost never verified. We address, in conclusion, the analogy with kinetic theory, and the reason why this analogy cannot be applied, in general, for turbulent flows. To cite this article: F.G. Schmitt, C. R.

  abstract = {In steep mountain streams, macro-roughness elements typically increase both flow energy dissipation and the threshold of motion compared to lower-gradient channels, reducing the part of the flow energy available for bed load transport. Bed load transport models typically take account of these effects either by reducing the acting bed shear stress or by increasing the critical parameters for particle entrainment. Here we evaluate bed load transport models for mixed-size sediments and models based on a median grain size using a large field data set of fractional bed load transport rates. We derive reference shear stresses and bed load transport relations based on both the total boundary shear stress and a reduced (or ``effective'') shear stress that accounts for flow resistance due to macro-roughness. When reference shear stresses are derived from the total boundary shear stress, they are closely related to channel slope, but when they are derived from the effective shear stress, they are almost invariant with channel slope. The performance of bed load transport models is generally comparable when using the total shear stress and a channel slope-related reference shear stress, or when using the effective shear stress and a constant reference shear stress. However, dimensionless bed load transport relations are significantly steeper for the total stress approach, whereas they are similar to the commonly used fractional Wilcock and Crowe (WC) transport model for the effective stress approach. This similarity in the relations allows the WC model, developed for lower-gradient streams, to be used in combination with an effective shear stress approach, in steep mountain streams.},

  abstract = {Compared to lower-gradient channels, steep mountain streams typically have rougher beds and shallower flow depths, making macro-scale flow resistance (due to, e.g., immobile boulders and irregular bedforms) more important as controls on sediment transport. The marked differences in hydraulics, flow resistance, and grain mobility between steep and lower-gradient streams raise the question of whether the same equations can predict bed load transport rates across wide ranges of channel gradients. We studied a steep, glacier-fed mountain stream (Riedbach, Ct. Valais, Switzerland) that provides a natural experiment for exploring how stream gradients affect bed load transport rates. The streambed gradient increases over a 1 km stream reach by roughly one order of magnitude (from 3\% to 38\%), while flow discharge and width remain approximately constant. Sediment transport rates were determined in the 3\% reach using Bunte bed load traps and in the 38\% reach using the Swiss plate geophone system. Despite a ten-fold increase in bed gradient, bed load transport rates did not increase substantially. Observed transport rates for these two very different bed gradients could be predicted reasonably well by using a flow resistance partitioning approach to account for increasing bed roughness (D84 changes from 0.17 m to 0.91 m) within a fractional bed load transport equation. This suggests that sediment transport behavior across this large range of steep slopes agrees with patterns established in previous studies for both lower-gradient and steep reaches, and confirms the applicability of the flow resistance and bed load transport equations at very steep slopes.},

One of the key factors in soil erosion control is the vegetation cover and crop type. However, determining these factors adequately for the use in soil erosion modeling is very time-consuming especially for large mountainous areas, such as the Xiangxi (香溪) catchment in the Three Gorges area. In our study, the crop and management factor C was calculated using the fractional vegetation cover (CFVC) based on Landsat-TM images from 2005, 2006, and 2007 and on literature studies (CLIT). In 2007, the values of CFVC range between 0.001 and 0.98 in the Xiangxi catchment. The mean CFVC value is 0.05. CLIT values are distinctly higher, ranging from 0.08 to 0.46 with a mean value of 0.32 in the Xiangxi catchment. The mean potential soil loss amounts to 120.62 t/ha/a in the Xiangxi catchment when using CLIT for modeling. Based on CFVC, the predicted mean soil loss in the Xiangxi catchment is 11.50 t/ha/a. Therefore, CLIT appears to be more reliable than the C factor based on the fractional vegetation cover.},

Increases exceeding the Clausius{\textendash}Clapeyron (CC) rate of 6{\textendash}7\%/{\textdegree}C{\textendash}1 are seen in short-duration, convective, high-percentile rainfall at mid latitudes, but the rates of change cease or revert at regionally variable threshold temperatures due to moisture limitations. It is unclear, however, what these findings mean in term of the actual risk of extreme precipitation on a regional to local scale. When conditioning precipitation intensities on local temperatures, key influences on the scaling relationship such as from the annual cycle and regional weather patterns need better understanding. Here we analyze these influences, using sub-hourly to daily precipitation data from a dense network of 189 stations in south-eastern Austria. We find that the temperature sensitivities in the mountainous western region are lower than in the eastern lowlands. This is due to the different weather patterns that cause extreme precipitation in these regions. Sub-hourly and hourly intensities intensify at super-CC and CC-rates, respectively, up to temperatures of about 17 {\textdegree}C. However, we also find that, because of the regional and seasonal variability of the precipitation intensities, a smaller scaling factor can imply a larger absolute change in intensity. Our insights underline that temperature precipitation scaling requires careful interpretation of the intent and setting of the study. When this is considered, conditional scaling factors can help to better understand which influences control the intensification of rainfall with temperature on a regional scale.},

  abstract = {Parameter estimation procedures are very important in the chemical engineering field for development of mathematical models, since design, optimization and advanced control of chemical processes depend on model parameter values obtained from experimental data. Model nonlinearity makes the estimation of parameter and the statistical analysis of parameter estimates more difficult and more challenging. In this work, it is shown that many of these difficulties can be overcome with the use of heuristic optimization methods, such as the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Parameter estimation problems are solved here with PSO and it is shown that the PSO method is efficient for both minimization and construction of the confidence region of parameter estimates. Moreover, it is shown that the elliptical approximation of confidence regions of nonlinear model parameters can be very poor sometimes and that more accurate likelihood confidence regions can be constructed with PSO, allowing for more reliable statistical analysis of the significance of parameter estimates.},

  abstract = {Analysis of bend-scale meandering river dynamics is a problem of theoretical and practical interest. This work introduces a method for extracting and analyzing the history of individual meander bends from inception until cutoff (called ``atoms'') by tracking backward through time the set of two cutoff nodes in numerical meander migration models. Application of this method to a simplified yet physically based model provides access to previously unavailable bend-scale meander dynamics over long times and at high temporal resolutions. We find that before cutoffs, the intrinsic model dynamics invariably simulate a prototypical cutoff atom shape we dub simple. Once perturbations from cutoffs occur, two other archetypal cutoff planform shapes emerge called long and round that are distinguished by a stretching along their long and perpendicular axes, respectively. Three measures of meander migration{\textemdash}growth rate, average migration rate, and centroid migration rate{\textemdash}are introduced to capture the dynamic lives of individual bends and reveal that similar cutoff atom geometries share similar dynamic histories. Specifically, through the lens of the three shape types, simples are seen to have the highest growth and average migration rates, followed by rounds, and finally longs. Using the maximum average migration rate as a metric describing an atom's dynamic past, we show a strong connection between it and two metrics of cutoff geometry. This result suggests both that early formative dynamics may be inferred from static cutoff planforms and that there exists a critical period early in a meander bend's life when its dynamic trajectory is most sensitive to cutoff perturbations. An example of how these results could be applied to Mississippi River oxbow lakes with unknown historic dynamics is shown. The results characterize the underlying model and provide a framework for comparisons against more complex models and observed dynamics.},

  abstract = {Sustainable concepts of ecologically functional rivers challenge engineers, researchers, and planners. Advanced numerical modeling techniques produce nowadays high-precision terrain maps and spatially explicit hydrodynamic data that aid river design. Because of their complexity, however, ecomorphological processes can only be reproduced to a limited extent in numerical models. Intelligent post-processing of hydrodynamic numerical model results still enables ecological river engineering measures to be designed sustainably. We have embedded state-of-the-art concepts in novel algorithms to effectively plan self-maintaining habitat-enhancing design features, such as vegetation plantings or the artificial introduction of streamwood, with high physical stability. The algorithms apply a previously developed lifespan mapping technique and habitat suitability analysis to terraforming and bioengineering river design features. The results not only include analytical synopses, but also provide actively created, automatically generated project plans, which are optimized as a function of an efficiency metric that describes "costs per m{$^2$} net gain in seasonal habitat area for target species". To make the benefits of these novel algorithms available to a wide audience, we have implemented the codes in an open-source program called River Architect. In this contribution, we present the novel design concepts and algorithms as well as a case study of their application to a river restoration project on the Yuba River in California (USA). With River Architect, we ultimately created an objective, parameter-based, and automated framework for the design of vegetative river engineering features. In addition, we are able to define a framework for stable and ecologically viable terraforming features, but part of the planning of earthworks is still left to expert assessment. Thus, improving the algorithms to plan terraforming of permanent, self-sustaining, and eco-morphodynamic riverbed structures based on site-specific parameters is one of the future challenges.}

Such full-complexity models are computationally demanding and their calibration is challenging regarding time, subjective decision-making, and measurement data availability. In addition, physically unrealistic model assumptions or combinations of calibration parameters may remain undetected and lead to overfitting. In this study, we investigate if and how so-called Bayesian calibration aids in characterizing faulty model setups driven by measurement data and calibration parameter combinations. Bayesian calibration builds on recent developments in machine learning and uses a Gaussian process emulator as a surrogate model, which runs considerably faster than a 3d numerical model. We Bayesian-calibrate a Delft3D-FLOW model of a pump-storage reservoir as a function of the background horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity, and initial water temperature profile. We consider three scenarios with varying degrees of faulty assumptions and different uses of flow velocity and water temperature measurements. One of the scenarios forces completely unrealistic, rapid lake stratification and still yields similarly good calibration accuracy as more correct scenarios regarding global statistics, such as the root-mean-square error. An uncertainty assessment resulting from the Bayesian calibration indicates that the completely unrealistic scenario forces fast lake stratification through highly uncertain mixing-related model parameters. Thus, Bayesian calibration describes the quality of calibration and correctness of model assumptions through geometric characteristics of posterior distributions. For instance, most likely calibration parameter values (posterior distribution maxima) at the calibration range limit or with widespread uncertainty characterize poor model assumptions and calibration.},

  abstract = {Rivers provide dynamic habitats with ecological niches, particularly in their mobile sand, gravel, and cobble riverbed patches that create an active hyporheic zone. Natural or artificial deposition of fine sediment may clog the porous matrix of the hyporheic zone, impairing exchange processes between the subsurface and surface water. Clogging reduces the permeability of the sediment matrix, thus degrading the ecological functionality of the hyporheic zone. Once clogged, the ecological functions may be recovered through active stream restoration, which requires considerate site assessment. To this end, clogging is typically assessed by expert opinion of substrate characteristics including grain size characteristics, porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and interstitial oxygen content. To overcome limitations of expert assessment, such as subjectivity expressed in noisy decision-making, this study introduces a novel fuzzy-logic method based on physically sound rules. The method provides quantitative indicators for clogging and declogging to evaluate the effectiveness of stream restoration. We applied the fuzzy-logic method to test whether the placement of large wood, a common restoration practice, can locally prevent or reduce clogging. Two measurement series from before and after a morphologically effective flood suggested that large wood placements perpendicular to the flow generate elevated amounts of declogging. The tested logs caused a greater amount of declogging within their region of influence than observed at a reference point. The effect was stronger for a log emergent at baseflow. The declogging assessment showed that the novel fuzzy-logic indicators can reasonably overcome subjective judgment by accounting for multi-variate quantitative changes rather than individual parameter trends.},

  abstract = {The estimation of bedload transport, a type of coarse fluvial sediment motion, is challenging because of higher-order, complex, and time-variable environmental processes. Still, models for calculating bedload transport mostly rely on semi-empirical formulae derived from time-averaged laboratory flume or field measurements and involve cross-section averaging of hydro-environmental parameters. Additionally, many models assume infinite, constant availability of sediment, which is unrealistic in natural environments. While most published models yield excellent results on the dataset they were trained on, they may be significantly inaccurate when applied to other cases. Also, more recent formulae relying on considerable amounts of data still lead to high calculation uncertainty. While the importance of short-term dynamics, for example, driven by turbulence, for bedload transport is well known, this study investigates the relevance of time-variable processes at monthly to seasonal scales. Our analysis of a large dataset and remote sensing data shows evidence for seasonal variability in measurements of bedload transport rates and challenges the validity of Gaussian statistics for interpolating bedload transport models. Measured bedload transport rates were smaller when snowmelt was taking place and when no glacier was present in the catchment, and were best represented by extreme value distributions. By controlling for biases from measurement devices, geomorphic patterns, and the presence of an upstream dam, we show that steady, constant at-a-station hydraulics only explain a limited share of the variance in the measurements. Ultimately, a model for estimating bedload transport rates should consider the temporal variability of processes across all scales, from turbulence to climate.},

  abstract = {Interactions between fluvial processes and floodplain ecosystems occur upon a floodplain surface that is often physically complex. Spatial patterns in floodplain topography have only recently been quantified over multiple scales, and discrepancies exist in how floodplain surfaces are perceived to be spatially organised. We measured spatial patterns in floodplain topography for pool 9 of the Upper Mississippi River, USA, using moving window analyses of eight surface metrics applied to a 1{\dbend}1m2 DEM over multiple scales. The metrics used were Range, SD, Skewness, Kurtosis, CV, SDCURV, Rugosity, and Vol:Area, and window sizes ranged from 10 to 1000m in radius. Surface metric values were highly variable across the floodplain and revealed a high degree of spatial organisation in floodplain topography. Moran's I correlograms fit to the landscape of each metric at each window size revealed that patchiness existed at nearly all window sizes, but the strength and scale of patchiness changed within window size, suggesting that multiple scales of patchiness and patch structure exist in the topography of this floodplain. Scale thresholds in the spatial patterns were observed, particularly between the 50 and 100m window sizes for all surface metrics and between the 500 and 750m window sizes for most metrics. These threshold scales are 15{\dbend}20\% and 150\% of the main channel width (1{\dbend}2\% and 10{\dbend}15\% of the floodplain width), respectively. These thresholds may be related to structuring processes operating across distinct scale ranges. By coupling surface metrics, multi-scale analyses, and correlograms, quantifying floodplain topographic complexity is possible in ways that should assist in clarifying how floodplain ecosystems are structured.},

Streambed horizontal hydraulic conductivities (Kh) were therefore determined from in-stream slug tests, vertical hydraulic conductivities (Kv) were calculated with in-stream permeameter tests and hydraulic heads were measured to obtain vertical head gradients at eight transects, each comprising five test locations, in a groundwater-dominated stream. Seasonal small-scale measurements were taken in December 2011 and August 2012, both in a straight stream channel with homogeneous elevation and downstream of a channel meander with heterogeneous elevation. All streambed attributes showed large spatial variability. Kh values were the highest at the depositional inner bend of the stream, whereas high Kv values were observed at the erosional outer bend and near the middle of the channel. Calculated Kv values were related to the thickness of the organic streambed sediment layer and also showed higher temporal variability than Kh because of sedimentation and scouring processes affecting the upper layers of the streambed. Test locations at the channel bend showed a more heterogeneous distribution of streambed properties than test locations in the straight channel, whereas within the channel bend, higher spatial variability in streambed attributes was observed across the stream than along the stream channel.

In this context, the clogging of riverbeds (colmation) can play a significant role because fine sediments can infiltrate into the riverbed and clog the pore space, which subsequently lead to a reduction in hydraulic conductivity and dissolved oxygen concentrations (Schaelchli, 1992). Although colmation is a natural process, the occurrence of colmated riverbeds can be a result of anthropogenic activities such as a non-natural increase of the fine sediment input or the regulation of flow. For the latter, the suppressed peak flows cannot induce bed alterations and thus initiate decolmation processes, resulting in a strengthening of colmation development.},

Although mathematical predictors can be used for estimation, they do not adequately represent porosities. The objective of this study was to assess a new approach for the determination of porosity of frozen sediment samples. The method is based on volume determination by applying Structure-from-Motion with Multi View Stereo (SfM-MVS) to estimate a 3D volumetric model based on overlapping imagery. The method was applied on artificial sediment mixtures as well as field samples. In addition, the commonly used water replacement method was applied to determine porosities in comparison with the SfM-MVS method. We examined a range of porosities from 0.16 to 0.46 that are representative of the wide range of porosities found in rivers. SfM-MVS performed well in determining volumes of the sediment samples. A very good correlation (r\,=\,0.998, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) was observed between the SfM-MVS and the water replacement method. Results further show that the water replacement method underestimated total sample volumes. A comparison with several mathematical predictors showed that for non-uniform samples the calculated porosity based on the standard deviation performed better than porosities based on the median grain size. None of the predictors were effective at estimating the porosity of the field samples.},

  abstract = {A stochastic weather generator is a model capable of generating daily weather patterns that are statistically similar to the observed patterns. Weather generators are commonly used in climate change studies as a computationally inexpensive tool to generate high resolution climate change scenarios based on the output from global climate models. Considering that the frequency and the magnitude of extreme weather events are likely to increase under climate change, there is a growing need to investigate how well weather extremes are simulated by weather generators. The aim of this study was to test the skill of the LARS-WG stochastic weather generator to simulate extreme weather events at 20 locations with diverse climates. Yearly maxima of daily precipitation, maximum temperature and length of heat waves, and their 10 and 20 yr return values were compared for observed and synthetic data by fitting the generalized extreme value distribution and computing confidence intervals. Means of yearly maxima and return values of daily synthetic precipitation were within the 95\% confidence intervals (CI95) of observed data for all sites. Daily maximum temperature extremes were reproduced less accurately. Although the root mean squared error (RMSE) calculated for the means of maxima of maximum temperature was {$<$}1{\textdegree}C, synthetic means for approximately half of the sites were outside the CI95 for observed values. This indicates that the assumption used in LARS-WG, that daily temperature could be approximated by the normal distribution, is inadequate. Means of yearly maxima for length of heat waves and 10 and 20 yr return values were within the CI95 for all sites except 3. For those sites where LARS-WG performance was inadequate, daily maximum temperature was not normally distributed but was skewed.},

Results show that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) method best reflects the sediment regime on these rivers. On the Ompompanoosuc River, regulated by a run-of-the-river/flood control dam, embeddedness increases significantly directly downstream of the dam. On the unregulated White River, no downstream trends in embeddedness are observed. The USEPA results on the Ompompanoosuc River reflect the movement of a local decrease in embeddedness, interpreted as a moving region of scour, with a calculated transport rate of approximately 5 to 25 m/day. Observed transport rates are similar to previously measured sediment transport rates and consistent with results from a multifraction sediment transport model. Application of the USEPA method to an additional regulated tributary demonstrates the effects of dam management on embeddedness. Flow regulation with high sediment trapping efficiency results in a decrease in embeddedness downstream of the dam. Results provide insight into the utility of available methods for evaluating the effects of management practice on streambed composition.},

Comparison of the results show that the dispersion coefficient tensor obtained directly from velocity profiles provided a more realistic solution that can describe the abrupt expansion of tracer clouds in the transverse direction. Heterogeneous longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients were inversely estimated from the calculated dispersion coefficient tensor based on the velocity profiles. Extremely large transverse dispersion coefficients were formed at the apex of the channel bend, where there was a well-developed secondary current.

Six calibration criteria specified in the Expert System for the Calibration of HSPF (HSPEXP) decision support tool were combined to develop a single, composite objective function for HSPF-SCE. The HSPF-SCE tool was demonstrated, and automated and manually calibrated model performance were compared using three Virginia watersheds, where HSPF models had been previously prepared for bacteria total daily maximum load (TMDL) development.

  abstract = {A groundwater flow model for east-central Florida has been developed to help water-resource managers assess the impact of increased groundwater withdrawals from the Floridan aquifer system on heads and spring flows originating from the Upper Floridan Aquifer. The model provides a probabilistic description of predictions of interest to water-resource managers, given the uncertainty associated with system heterogeneity, the large number of input parameters, and a nonunique groundwater flow solution. The uncertainty associated with these predictions can then be considered in decisions with which the model has been designed to assist. The ``Null Space Monte Carlo'' method is a stochastic probabilistic approach used to generate a suite of several hundred parameter field realizations, each maintaining the model in a calibrated state, and each considered to be hydrogeologically plausible. The results presented herein indicate that the model's capacity to predict changes in heads or spring flows that originate from increased groundwater withdrawals is considerably greater than its capacity to predict the absolute magnitudes of heads or spring flows. Furthermore, the capacity of the model to make predictions that are similar in location and in type to those in the calibration dataset exceeds its capacity to make predictions of different types at different locations. The quantification of these outcomes allows defensible use of the modeling process in support of future water-resources decisions. The model allows the decision-making process to recognize the uncertainties, and the spatial or temporal variability of uncertainties that are associated with predictions of future system behavior in a complex hydrogeological context.},

The goals of this study include (i) analysis of the applicability of multiobjective approach for WetSpa calibration instead of the traditional approach, i.e. the Parameter ESTimator software (PEST), and (ii) identifiability assessment of model parameters. The objective functions considered are model efficiency (Nash-Sutcliffe criterion) known to be biased for high flows, and model efficiency for logarithmic transformed discharges to emphasize low-flow values. For the multi-objective approach, Pareto-optimal parameter sets are derived, whereas for the single-objective formulation, PEST is applied to give optimal parameter sets. The two approaches are evaluated by applying the WetSpa model to predict daily discharges in the Hornad River (Slovakia) for a 10 year period (1991{\textendash}2000). The results reveal that NSGA-II performs favourably well to locate Pareto optimal solutions in the parameters search space. Furthermore, identifiability analysis of the WetSpa model parameters shows that most parameters are well-identifiable. However, in order to perform an appropriate model evaluation, more efforts should be focused on improving calibration concepts and to define robust methods to quantify different sources of uncertainties involved in the calibration procedure.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have revealed the close coupling of components of annual streamflow hydrographs and the germination and establishment ofPopulus species. Key hydrograph components include the timing and magnitude of flood peaks, the rate of decline of the recession limb, and the magnitude of base flows. In this paper, we retrospectively examine establishment of four woody riparian species along the Bill Williams River, Arizona, USA, in the context of annual patterns of streamflow for the years 1993{\textendash}1995. The four species examined were the nativePopulus fremontii, Salix gooddingii, andBaccharis salicifolia and the exoticTamarix ramosissima. We modeled locations suitable for germination of each species along eight study transects by combining historic discharge data, calculated stage-discharge relationships, and seed-dispersal timing observations. This germination model was, a highly significant predictor of seedling establishment. Where germination was predicted to occur, we compared values of several environmental variables in quadrats where we observed successful establishment with quadrats where establishment was unsuccessful. The basal area of mature woody vegetation, the maximum annual, depth to ground water, and the maximum rate of water-table decline were the variables that best discriminated between quadrats with and without seedlings. The results of this study suggest that the basic components of models that relate establishment ofPopulus spp. to annual patterns of streamflow may also be applicable to other woody riparian species. Reach-to-reach variation in stage-discharge relationships can influence model parameters, however, and should be considered if results such as ours are to be used in efforts to prescribe reservoir releases to promote establishment of native riparian vegetation.},

  abstract = {Channel confluence is one of the important features of each river system and some hydraulic structures. The features that can dominantly control flow characteristics in a confluence are confluence angle, discharge, width ratios, and Froude number of flow. Several research studies have been conducted however a comprehensive three-dimensional (3-D) numerical study of flow characteristics in a confluence has not yet been reported. In the present study, SSIIM2.0, a 3-D numerical model, is validated and applied to investigate secondary currents, velocity distribution, flow separation, and water surface elevation in different conditions. The results of the present study illustrate that flow structure and water surface variations in a confluence are highly influenced by confluence angle, discharge, and width ratios as well as Froude number because of their effect on flow deflection, separation, and secondary currents. The graphs from the present study can be used to analyze water surface variation, velocity field, and flow separation dimensions in difference conditions for engineering designs.

The Reynolds stress transport model of the FLUENTTM code was used for evaluating the river flow characteristics, including the mean velocity field and the Reynolds stress components. The simulation results were compared with the available experimental data of the river model and discussed. The Lagrangian tracking of individual particles was performed, and the transport and deposition of particles of various sizes in the meandering river were analyzed. Particular attention was given to the sedimentation patterns of different size particles in the river-bend model. The flow patterns in a physical river were also studied. A Froude number based scale ratio of 1:100 was used, and the flow patterns in the physical and river models are compared. The result shows that the mean-flow quantities exhibit dynamic similarity, but the turbulence parameters of the physical river are different from the model. More strikingly, the particle sedimentation features in the physical and river models do not obey the expected similarity scaling.},

A simple search strategy in PSO guides the algorithm toward the best solution through constant updating of the cognitive knowledge and social behavior of the particles in the swarm. To evaluate the applicability of PSO to inversion of geophysical data, we inverted three noise-corrupted synthetic sounding data sets over a multilayered 1D earth model by using DC, induced polarization ͑IP͒, and magnetotelluric ͑MT͒ methods. The results show that acceptable solutions can be obtained with a swarm of about 300 particles and that convergence occurs in less than 100 iterations. The time required to execute a PSO algorithm is comparable to that of a genetic algorithm ͑GA͒. Similarly, the models estimated from PSO and GA are close to the true solutions. Whereas a ridge regression ͑RR͒ algorithm converges in four to eight iterations, it yields satisfactory results only when the initial model is very close to the true model. Models estimated from PSO explain observed, vertical electric sounding ͑VES͒ and MT data, from Bhiwani district, Haryana, India, and the Chottanagpur gneissic complex, Dhanbad, India.

  abstract = {Sediment dynamics have an important influence on the morphological evolution of tidal wetlands, which consist of mudflats and salt marshes. To understand the nature of sediment behavior under combined current{\textendash}wave action at an exposed tidal wetland, we measured the waves, currents, water depths, bed-level changes, and sediment properties at a mudflat{\textendash}salt marsh transition on the Yangtze Delta, China, during five consecutive tides under onshore winds of {\textasciitilde}8m/s, and calculated the bed shear stresses due to currents ({$\tau$}c), waves ({$\tau$}w), combined current{\textendash}wave action ({$\tau$}cw), and the critical shear stress for erosion of the bottom sediment ({$\tau$}ce). The bed shear stresses under combined current{\textendash}wave action ({$\tau$}cw) were approximately five times higher on the mudflat (up to 1.11N/m2; average 0.27N/m2) than on the salt marsh (up to 0.14N/m2; average, 0.06N/m2). On the mudflat, {$\tau$}cw was larger than the critical erosion shear stress ({$\tau$}ce=0.103N/m2) for 70\% of the period of submergence, whereas {$\tau$}cw was always lower than {$\tau$}ce at the salt marsh site ({$\tau$}ce=0.116N/m2). This result indicates that the sediment dynamics on the mudflat were dominated by erosion, whereas at the salt marsh they were governed by deposition, which is in agreement with the observed bed-level change during the study period (-3.3mm/tide on the mudflat and 3.0mm/tide on the salt marsh). A comparison of {$\tau$}cw values calculated using the van Rijn, 1993, Soulsby, 1995 models for bed shear stresses under combined current{\textendash}wave action indicates that both models are applicable to the present case and effectively predict the bottom shear stress under combined current{\textendash}wave action. Overall, we conclude that {$\tau$}cw in combination with {$\tau$}ce is useful in assessing the hydrodynamic mechanisms that underlie the morphological evolution of exposed tidal wetlands.},

Determination of critical shear stresses for erosion and deposition based on in situ measurements of currents and waves over an intertidal mudflat.Accurate determination of the critical shear stress associated with the erosion and deposition of sediments is an important component of numerical models used to predict and quantify sediment behavior and transport across intertidal flats. In this study, water depth, wave parameters, near-bed turbulent velocity, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), and intratidal bed-level changes were measured to determine the erosion ({$\tau$}ce) and deposition ({$\tau$}cd) thresholds of sediments on an intertidal mudflat at Jiangsu, China. Based on integrated field measurements of bed-level changes and hydrodynamics, the bed shear stresses of currents ({$\tau$}c), waves ({$\tau$}w), and combined current-wave action ({$\tau$}cw) were calculated, and the critical shear stress required for erosion ({$\tau$}ce = 0.14 N/m2) and deposition ({$\tau$}cd = 0.08 N/m2) of these sediments was determined. Both values are in agreement with an estimate of {$\tau$}ce (0.13 N/m2) that was based on water content and {$\tau$}cd values calculated by previous works, indicating that the value of {$\tau$}ce estimated for these sediments is controlled primarily by the water content of the sediments. During field measurements, deposition occurred ({$\tau$}cw \&lt; {$\tau$}cd) when current action exceeded wave energy ({$\tau$}c \&gt; {$\tau$}w) during calm weather, whereas erosion occurred ({$\tau$}cw \&gt; {$\tau$}ce) when wave action increased dramatically during rough weather. Our field data showed that high current velocities lead to low {$\tau$}c, possibly because high SSC reduced the drag coefficient, which is variable during a tide, and further caused low {$\tau$}c under high current velocities. Additionally, bedforms characteristic of intertidal mudflat (e.g., gullies, small creeks, ripples, or saltmarsh) has a significant influence on the drag coefficient of the bed. These observations suggest that the bed level responds strongly to changing hydrodynamic conditions, and also that waves are of great importance to erosion. This study demonstrates that the in situ determination of the parameters that control erosion and deposition is a useful approach to obtaining values of {$\tau$}ce and {$\tau$}cd, which provide the basis for a mechanistic understanding of the morphological evolution and development of predictive sediment transport and erodibility models.}

  abstract = {The response of suspended sediment load to climate change has important implications for downstream ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. Glaciers, permafrost, vegetation and hydrological processes are rapidly changing in high-altitude regions. However, there is currently no consensus about how and to what extent these factors will affect interannual changes of fluvial sediment export. Here, we investigate the increasing trend of suspended sediment load in the headwaters of the Brahmaputra River from 1972 to 2008. The key influencing factors, including the hydrodynamic flux and erosivity of glacier runoff, precipitation, vegetation cover, and soil erodibility were quantified, and their changing trends were analyzed. Two methods were used to attribute the variation of sediment load; Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM) based on statistical regression and Sediment Identity (SI) based on algebraic equations. The results obtained by these two relatively independent methods were broadly consistent, and the error of the SI model was less than 8\%. The sediment load showed a significant increasing trend at an average changing rate of 18.9\%/10a, without any abrupt fluctuations. The increase in fluvial sediment load was primarily due to increases in both the amount (43\%) and erosivity (55\%) of precipitation, combined with minor influences from increased sediment supply due to earlier thawing (16\%) and intensified glacier melting (14\%). The increases in fluvial sediment load were partially buffered by a decrease in water yield capacity due to denser vegetation cover (-29\%). This study provides valuable insights into the natural response of fluvial sediment loads to climatic and environmental change, and the findings are critical for soil and water conservation planning in cold and high-altitude regions.},

Five mg/L NR solution in n-hexane effectively stained plastics, and they were easily recognized in green fluorescence. The NR staining method was successfully applied to micro-sized polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyurethane, and poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate), except for polyvinylchloride, polyamide and polyester. The recovery rate of polyethylene (100{\textendash}300 {$\mu$}m) spiked to pretreated natural sand was 98\% in the NR stating method, which was not significantly (p b 0.05) different with FT-IR identification. The NR staining method was suitable for discriminating fragmented polypropylene particles from large numbers of sand particles in laboratory weathering test samples. The method is straightforward and quick for identifying and quantifying polymer particles in the laboratory controlled samples. Further studies, however, are necessary to investigate the application of NR staining to field samples with organic remnants.},

Comparisons of flow structures and bedforms between different floodplain rougheness are made. Considerable changes in the flow structure and bed form were observed. In particular, multiple secondary flow cells along the meandering channel occur at deeper water depths as the floodplain roughness increases. These cells also cause a series of wavy bedforms along the meandering channel. This paper is separated into two parts. Part I concentrates, in detail, on the flow structure with bedforms in the meandering channel for overbank flow as to change of floodplain roughness.

Simulations with the model demonstrate how the value of soil conservation depends on the cost of investing, the risk characteristics of the soil conservation method and differences among households in capacity to bear risk. Model predictions are compared with empirical adoption patterns, as described by a probit model and nonparametric kernel regressions of adoption probability. Empirical findings show how differences in farm size, tenure security, risk exposure, and access to credit help to explain patterns of soil conservation adoption.

  abstract = {Sediment transport in meanders is a complex phenomenon due to its three-dimensional behavior (i.e., the presence of secondary currents). As a result, in river bends, sediments are eroded from the outer bank, resulting in depositions at the inner bank. In order to describe the complexity of flow characteristics and sediment transport mechanisms in river bends, the use of three-dimensional numerical models is essential. Nevertheless, these models are highly parameterized; therefore, the model calibration process becomes demanding. Using optimization methods for model calibration can diminish the manual effort and avoid users' subjectivity. Besides, it helps to decrease errors caused by wrong assumptions and unrealistic combinations of involving parameters. In this study, the 3D numerical model SSIIM 2 is used to simulate the flow field as well as morphological bed changes in a U-shaped bend. The automatic calibration tool PEST is used to calibrate the morphodynamic model by altering different input parameters. The result of this study reveals that using automatic calibration can noticeably reduce the calibration time and the user-intervention in the calibration process. Comparisons between the simulated bed topography changes and the experimental data regarding the deposition and scour regions, as well as their magnitudes, demonstrate a high degree of accuracy for the automatic calibration process.},

  abstract = {In curved channels, the flow characteristics, sediment transport mechanisms, and bed evolution are more complex than in straight channels, owing to the interaction between the centrifugal force and the pressure gradient, which results in the formation of secondary currents. Therefore, using an appropriate numerical model that considers this fully three-dimensional effect, and subsequently, the model calibration are substantial tasks for achieving reliable simulation results. The calibration of numerical models as a subjective approach can become challenging and highly time-consuming, especially for inexperienced modelers, due to dealing with a large number of input parameters with respect to hydraulics and sediment transport. Using optimization methods can notably facilitate and expedite the calibration procedure by reducing the user intervention, which results in a more objective selection of parameters. This study focuses on the application of four different optimization algorithms for calibration of a 3D morphodynamic numerical model of a curved channel. The performance of a local gradient-based method is compared with three global optimization algorithms in terms of accuracy and computational time (model runs). The outputs of the optimization methods demonstrate similar sets of calibrated parameters and almost the same degree of accuracy according to the achieved minimum of the objective function. Accordingly, the most efficient method concerning the number of model runs (i.e., local optimization method) is selected for further investigation by setting up additional numerical models using different sediment transport formulae and various discharge rates. The comparisons of bed topography changes in several longitudinal and cross-sections between the measured data and the results of the calibrated numerical models are presented. The outcomes show an acceptable degree of accuracy for the automatically calibrated models.},

Future climate (temperature and precipitation) from four general circulation models (GCMs) that are found to perform well in the Mekong region and a regional circulation model (PRECIS) are downscaled using a delta change approach. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to assess future changes in sediment flux attributable to climate change. Results indicate up to 3.0 {\textdegree}C shift in seasonal temperature and 27\% (decrease) to 41\% (increase) in seasonal precipitation. The largest increase in temperature is observed in the dry season while the largest change in precipitation is observed in the wet season. In general, temperature shows increasing trends but changes in precipitation are not unidirectional and vary depending on the greenhouse gas emission scenarios (GHGES), climate models, prediction period and season. The simulation results show that the changes in annual stream discharges are likely to range from a 17\% decrease to 66\% increase in the future, which will lead to predicted changes in annual sediment yield ranging from a 27\% decrease to about 160\% increase. Changes in intra-annual (monthly) discharge as well as sediment yield are even greater (-62 to 105\% in discharge and -88 to 243\% in sediment yield). A higher discharge and sediment flux are expected during the wet seasons, although the highest relative changes are observed during the dry months. The results indicate high uncertainties in the direction and magnitude of changes of discharge as well as sediment yields due to climate change. As the projected climate change impact on sediment varies remarkably between the different climate models, the uncertainty should be taken into account in both sediment management and climate change adaptation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

First, we analyze the delay and time span of article downloads and Twitter mentions following submission, to understand the temporal configuration of these reactions and whether one precedes or follows the other. Second, we run regression and correlation tests to investigate the relationship between Twitter mentions, arXiv downloads, and article citations. We find that Twitter mentions and arXiv downloads of scholarly articles follow two distinct temporal patterns of activity, with Twitter mentions having shorter delays and narrower time spans than arXiv downloads. We also find that the volume of Twitter mentions is statistically correlated with arXiv downloads and early citations just months after the publication of a preprint, with a possible bias that favors highly mentioned articles.},

  abstract = {A combination of the classical deterministic mechanics of soil erosion and stochastic description of controlling erosion factors (driving and resistance forces) gives significant advantages and leads to the development of a new (the third) generation of erosion models. In contrast to existing models, the STOSEM model allows determination of the relationship between the rate of erosion and controlling factors inside the model theoretically, by a solution of the governing deterministic equations with stochastic initial and boundary conditions. It is possible to calculate the mean erosion rate explicitly from the probability density functions (PDFs) of flow velocity, soil aggregate size, cohesion, integrity and other basic controlling factors. Variability of the PDFs of controlling factors through time and space due to the changes in flow regimen and/ or soil composition produces differences in the structure of relationship between the mean erosion rate and controlling factors, as well as in resulting mean rate of erosion. The model is still far from application due to the lack of specific experimental data for validation. Nevertheless, its theoretical basement, transparency and flexibility show new direction in soil erosion science.},

Analytical models cannot adequately represent complex settings with, for example, transient boundary conditions, varying geometry of surface water{\textendash}groundwater interface, unsaturated and overland flow, etc. To understand the influence of parameters such as (1) sloping river banks, (2) varying hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed and (3) different river discharge wave scenarios on hyporheic exchange characteristics such as (a) bank storage, (b) return flows and (c) residence time, a 2-D hydrogeological conceptual model and, subsequently, an adequate numerical model were developed. The numerical model was calibrated against observations in the aquifer adjacent to the hydropower-regulated Lule River, northern Sweden, which has predominantly diurnal discharge fluctuations during summer and long-lasting discharge peaks during autumn and winter. Modelling results revealed that bank storage increased with river wave amplitude, wave duration and smaller slope of the river bank, while maximum exchange flux decreased with wave duration. When a homogeneous clogging layer covered the entire river{\textendash}aquifer interface, hydraulic conductivity positively affected bank storage. The presence of a clogging layer with hydraulic conductivity {$<$} 0.001 m d-1 significantly reduced the exchange flows and virtually eliminated bank storage. The bank storage return/fill time ratio was positively related to wave amplitude and the hydraulic conductivity of the interface and negatively to wave duration and bank slope. Discharge oscillations with short duration and small amplitude decreased bank storage and, therefore, the hyporheic exchange, which has implications for solute fluxes, redox conditions and the potential of riverbeds as fish-spawning locations. Based on these results, river regulation strategies can be improved by considering the effect of certain wave event configurations on hyporheic exchange to ensure harmonious hydrogeochemical functioning of the river{\textendash}aquifer interfaces and related ecosystems.}

If approached na{\"i}vely, however, such modeling can produce results that do not have sufficient accuracy or reliability to be useful in decision making or design regarding a range of remediation or stabilization alternatives. It is important to recognize the numerical modeling process as merely one step toward a more complete and balanced understanding of the fluvial or estuarine system in question. Other steps include qualitative and quantitative geomorphic and engineering analyses used to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of numerical modeling as part of a three-level approach to analyze sediment mobility and overall channel behavior and trends. It must first be recognized that attempting to quantitatively analyze sediment mobility involves developing and applying simplified mathematical algorithms to the complexities of continually varying hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes through natural or modified bodies of water. Accuracy in sediment modeling can only be assessed by comparing measured data to model results with accuracy being defined as the model results matching the data within some acceptable band of uncertainty. Reliability of a sediment model is the concept of dependability in reproducing the processes one is attempting to model and implies that a model includes appropriate mathematical expressions that cover the pertinent physical processes of hydrodynamics and sediment mobility. The concept of reasonableness in sediment modeling is the evaluation of results, when compared with other independent analyses in the application of the three-level process, provide an acceptable level of consistency and consensus of conclusions. The importance of modeling software selection, data quality, model calibration, verification, validation, and reasonableness of results are discussed along with two case studies.},

A post-project monitoring programme of 5 years was set up, which included hydrological, morphological and ecological parameters. This article focuses on the monitoring of aquatic macrophytes, aquatic macroinvertebrates, fish and wading-birds. The results show that man-made, excavated secondary channels function as a biotope for riverine species including the more demanding rheophilic species. The demands for shipping and protection against flooding on the River Waal cause constraints on secondary channels. Despite these constraints there is still enough space for hydromorphological processes to create new habitats in secondary channel 1, near Opijnen. The space for hydromorphological processes is less in secondary channel 2, near Beneden-Leeuwen. The density and the number of (rheophilic) species are for a large part influenced by the water level and frequent inundation caused by the high hydrological connectivity. Man-made secondary channels seem to provide suitable habitat that is currently lacking for a broad range of rheophilic macroinvertebrate and fish species in the Lower River Rhine in The Netherlands. Owing to the lack of suitable habitats for rheophilic macroinvertebrate and fish species before the creation of the secondary channels, the importance of longitudinal and transversal migration could be illustrated by the drift of macroinvertebrates during floods and the seasonal migration of Age-0 and Age-1+ fish species.

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

  abstract = {An efficient approach is introduced to help automate the rather tedious manual trial and error way of model calibration currently used in activated sludge modeling practice. To this end, we have evaluated a Monte Carlo based calibration approach consisting of four steps: (i) parameter subset selection, (ii) defining parameter space, (iii) parameter sampling for Monte Carlo simulations and (iv) selecting the best Monte Carlo simulation thereby providing the calibrated parameter values. The approach was evaluated on a formerly calibrated full-scale ASM2d model for a domestic plant (located in The Netherlands), using in total 3 months of dynamic oxygen, ammonia and nitrate sensor data. The Monte Carlo calibrated model was validated successfully using ammonia, oxygen and nitrate data collected at high measurement frequency. Statistical analysis of the residuals using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and Janus coefficient showed that the calibrated model was able to provide statistically accurate and valid predictions for ammonium, oxygen and nitrate. This shows that this pragmatic approach can perform the task of model calibration and therefore be used in practice to save the valuable time of modelers spent on this step of activated sludge modeling. The high computational demand is a downside of this approach but this can be overcome by using distributed computing. Overall we expect that the use of such systems analysis tools in the application of activated sludge models will improve the quality of model predictions and their use in decision making.},

The model was calibrated and validated using field-measured data pertaining to 86 storms of monsoon season 2003 and 98 storms of 2004. The daily simulated runoff and sediment yield of the Umroi watershed for the calibration and validation periods were found to match with their measured counterparts at 95\% significance level as shown by the Student's t-tests. The model simulated daily runoff quite well as corroborated by reasonably high Nash{\textendash}Sutcliffe simulation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.87, low root mean square errors of 1.42 and 1.77mm, and low percent deviations of -1.71 and -3.01, respectively for calibration and validation periods. The performance of the model for simulating daily sediment yield was also quite good with Nash{\textendash}Sutcliffe simulation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.90, root mean square errors of 0.08 and 0.09Mgha-1 and percent deviations of 3.05 and -5.23, respectively for calibration and validation periods. Subsequently, the calibrated and validated model was used to simulate vegetative (crop, level of fertilization and tillage) and structural (rock-fill check dam and trash barrier) measures and combinations of vegetative and structural control to evaluate their impacts on runoff and sediment yield reduction. Simulations of different vegetative management scenarios indicated that replacing traditional bun agriculture and upland paddy crop with maize, soybean, and peanut would reduce sediment yield by 18.68, 29.60 and 27.70\%, respectively. Field cultivator and drill-no-tillage systems have the potential to reduce sediment yield by 13.14 and 21.88\%, respectively as compared to the existing practice of spading and country plough. Installation of 8 check dams and 18 trash barriers in the drainage line was predicted to reduce sediment yield from the Umroi watershed substantially with reduction of 54.67\%. Simulations of combinations of management practices indicted that soybean and peanut in upland situations with field cultivator or drill-no-tillage system, and structural control in the drainage line has potential to make agriculture sustainable in the Umroi watershed with sediment yield reduction up to 78.40\%. The results of the study indicate that the WEPP model can be successfully used for developing conservation management practices in high rainfall and high slope conditions of eastern Himalaya.},

  abstract = {The use of a physically-based hydrological model for streamflow forecasting is limited by the complexity in the model structure and the data requirements for model calibration. The calibration of such models is a difficult task, and running a complex model for a single simulation can take up to several days, depending on the simulation period and model complexity. The information contained in a time series is not uniformly distributed. Therefore, if we can find the critical events that are important for identification of model parameters, we can facilitate the calibration process. The aim of this study is to test the applicability of the Identification of Critical Events (ICE) algorithm for physically-based models and to test whether ICE algorithm-based calibration depends on any optimization algorithm. The ICE algorithm, which uses the data depth function, was used herein to identify the critical events from a time series. Low depth in multivariate data is an unusual combination and this concept was used to identify the critical events on which the model was then calibrated. The concept is demonstrated by applying the physically-based hydrological model WaSiM-ETH on the Rems catchment, Germany. The model was calibrated on the whole available data, and on critical events selected by the ICE algorithm. In both calibration cases, three different optimization algorithms, shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA), parameter estimation (PEST) and robust parameter estimation (ROPE), were used. It was found that, for all the optimization algorithms, calibration using only critical events gave very similar performance to that using the whole time series. Hence, the ICE algorithmbased calibration is suitable for physically-based models; it does not depend much on the kind of optimization algorithm. These findings may be useful for calibrating physically-based models on much fewer data.},

The percentage of data bracketed by the 95\% prediction uncertainty (95PPU) and the r factor were the two measures used to assess the goodness of calibration. Comparison of the results of the two models shows that the value of r factor (r = 0.41) in the RBNN model is less than that of SWAT model (r = 0.79), which means there is a wider prediction interval for the SWAT model results. More values of observed sediment yield were bracketed by the 95PPU in the RBNN model. Thus, the RBNN model estimates the sediment yield values more accurately and with less uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The Gauss{\textendash}Marquardt{\textendash}Levenberg (GML) method of computer-based parameter estimation, in common with other gradient-based approaches, suffers from the drawback that it may become trapped in local objective function minima, and thus report ``optimized'' parameter values that are not, in fact, optimized at all. This can seriously degrade its utility in the calibration of watershed models where local optima abound. Nevertheless, the method also has advantages, chief among these being its model-run efficiency, and its ability to report useful information on parameter sensitivities and covariances as a by-product of its use. It is also easily adapted to maintain this efficiency in the face of potential numerical problems (that adversely affect all parameter estimation methodologies) caused by parameter insensitivity and/or parameter correlation. The present paper presents two algorithmic enhancements to the GML method that retain its strengths, but which overcome its weaknesses in the face of local optima. Using the first of these methods an ``intelligent search'' for better parameter sets is conducted in parameter subspaces of decreasing dimensionality when progress of the parameter estimation process is slowed either by numerical instability incurred through problem ill-posedness, or when a local objective function minimum is encountered. The second methodology minimizes the chance of successive GML parameter estimation runs finding the same objective function minimum by starting successive runs at points that are maximally removed from previous parameter trajectories. As well as enhancing the ability of a GML-based method to find the global objective function minimum, the latter technique can also be used to find the locations of many non-global optima (should they exist) in parameter space. This can provide a useful means of inquiring into the well-posedness of a parameter estimation problem, and for detecting the presence of bimodal parameter and predictive probability distributions.},

The solver is discretized using centroidal Voronoi meshes and a C-grid staggering of the prognostic variables, and it incorporates a split-explicit time-integration technique used in many existing nonhydrostatic meso- and cloud-scale models. MPAS can be applied to the globe, over limited areas of the globe, and on Cartesian planes. The Voronoi meshes are unstructured grids that permit variable horizontal resolution. These meshes allow for applications beyond uniform-resolution NWP and climate prediction, in particular allowing embedded high-resolution regions to be used for regional NWP and regional climate applications. The rationales for aspects of this formulation are discussed, and results from tests for nonhydrostatic flows on Cartesian planes and for large-scale flow on the sphere are presented. The results indicate that the solver is as accurate as existing nonhydrostatic solvers for nonhydrostatic-scale flows, and has accuracy comparable to existing global models using icosahedral (hexagonal) meshes for large-scale flows in idealized tests. Preliminary full-physics forecast results indicate that the solver formulation is robust and that the variable-resolution-mesh solutions are well resolved and exhibit no obvious problems in the mesh-transition zones.}

  abstract = {Background, Aims, and Scope. Sediment management in coastal zones is taking place in high complex environments. Present management options do not have a sophisticated way of dealing with the actual complexity of the physical and the social systems and with the unpredictability that is inherent with these systems. Therefore, a new approach in both policy making and sediment management is needed that takes this complexity into account. The aim of this article is to explore the dynamics in social and natural systems and to draw the contours of this new approach for policy processes and sediment management that fits to the dynamics of the systems. Methods. Three case studies concerning sediment management in Germany and the Netherlands are analysed in this article, in which unpredictability, or whimsicality, appeared through the occurrence of unexpected events. The case studies are analysed from the perspective of complexity theory. Complexity theory is a systemic theory, which means that it explains empirical phenomena from complex system behaviour. To understand the capricious character of sediment management in coastal zones, we need to frame the issue as the interdependency between the physical system and the social system, causing the two systems to develop in mutual adjustment through feedback. The process of mutual adjustment is one that is characterised by a non-linear nature. This is caused by the multiple relationships and the feedback within and between the systems, and the occurrence of chance events. Chance events (surprises) happen suddenly without an apparent cause and are important triggers for change in the systems. In three empirical cases, the occurrence, nature and response to these chance events are analysed as these factors influence the course of sediment management. Results and Discussion. The case studies show that chance events can occur in the biophysical and in the social system. In the three cases, players or actors in the decision process are left with the choice to adapt themselves to the occurring chance events or to refrain from any adaptive behaviour. Chance events can open up new possibilities by activating (new) actors and by coupling to new issues. If the situation is too locked-in (i.e. a stalemate) and is intentional on behalf of the actors, than the chance event will have no effect. There are, however, situations of lock-in that are unintentional, and in such situations a chance event can remove this lock-in. The effects depend largely on the adaptive capacity of the actors to respond adequately and timely to such situations. The adaptive capacity can be increased (and uncertainty reduced) by a better understanding of both the physical and the social system. The case studies show that adaptation is an adequate way of dealing with the occurrence of chance events. Conclusions. We conclude that the way to deal with non-linear developments is through an adaptive policy approach with short feedback loops in order to allow for timely adjustments and learning loops that will progress the understanding of the systems - both social and physical. Besides the instruments that are already available, like modelling and forecasting, instruments like observation and monitoring, stakeholder involvement processes, and learning and adaptation should be developed in this new adaptive approach. Monitoring of the physical system is a key element in this approach as all involved parties and stake-holders can learn how the physical system behaves. In this adaptive approach, whimsicality - that occurs through unexpected events - is an interesting challenge for all concerned with sediment management. Recommendations and Perspectives. The proposed adaptive policy approach should be developed further and should be experimented with in real life situations that are well monitored.}

  abstract = {Understanding how fish perceive turbulence characteristics to utilize complex habitats (large wood, rock, channel bedforms, etc.) is a critical, but poorly understood component of aquatic habitat restoration. Many recent studies attempt to relate turbulence characteristics to habitat utilization, but results are inconsistent for two reasons. First, turbulence is a complex, multi-scale manifestation of fluid flow that can be characterized in different ways with different interpretations. Second, fish behavioral response to flow field features is also complex because both acclimation and learning are important. For example, some studies show that turbulence decreases swimming stability, increases energy expenditure for a given swimming speed, and alters feeding behavior, whereas others show turbulence to decrease energy needed to swim at a given speed and correlates with fish abundance. We describe a Turbulence Attraction and Avoidance (TAA) hypothesis to reconcile inconsistent, even seemingly contradictory, findings. The TAA hypothesis creates a new perspective of turbulence, habitat complexity, and fish habitat occupancy by acknowledging that fish, like all animals, perceive their environment at their own relevant scales and in a conditional manner, dependent on their prior exposure history.},

  abstract = {Studies of reservoir sedimentation are vital to understanding scientific and management issues related to watershed sediment budgets, depositional processes, reservoir operations, and dam decommissioning. Here we quantify the mass, organic content, and grain-size distribution of a reservoir deposit in northern California by two methods of extrapolating measurements of sediment physical properties from cores to the entire volume of impounded material. Englebright Dam, completed in 1940, is located on the Yuba River in the Sierra Nevada foothills. A research program is underway to assess the feasibility of introducing wild anadromous fish species to the river upstream of the dam. Possible management scenarios include removing or lowering the dam, which could cause downstream transport of stored sediment. In 2001 the volume of sediments deposited behind Englebright Dam occupied 25.5\% of the original reservoir capacity. The physical properties of this deposit were calculated using data from a coring campaign that sampled the entire reservoir sediment thickness (6{\textendash}32 m) at six locations in the downstream {$\sim$}3/4 of the reservoir. As a result, the sediment in the downstream part of the reservoir is well characterized, but in the coarse, upstream part of the reservoir, only surficial sediments were sampled, so calculations there are more uncertain. Extrapolation from one-dimensional vertical sections of sediment sampled in cores to entire three-dimensional volumes of the reservoir deposit is accomplished via two methods, using assumptions of variable and constant layer thickness. Overall, the two extrapolation methods yield nearly identical estimates of the mass of the reservoir deposit of {$\sim$}26 {\texttimes} 106 metric tons (t) of material, of which 64.7{\textendash}68.5\% is sand and gravel. Over the 61 year reservoir history this corresponds to a maximum basin-wide sediment yield of {$\sim$}340 t/km2/yr, assuming no contribution from upstream parts of the watershed impounded by other dams. The uncertainties and limitations of the estimates of overall sediment quantities are discussed. Implications for watershed management and future reservoir sedimentation studies are also presented.},

  abstract = {The interactions of hydrological variables in the terrestrial hydrological cycle are complex. To better predict the variables, distributed and physically based models are used as they account for the complexity of interactions. In this study, we addressed the joint simulation of water- and energy fluxes and the potential benefit of flux measurements in the parameter estimation process. For this purpose, we applied the hydrological model GEOtop to a prealpine catchment in southern Germany (River Rott, 55 km2) over two recent summer episodes, as a test case. Due to its complexity, the model is computationally demanding and only a limited number of forward runs can be afforded in inverse modelling and parameter estimation. We applied the gradient-based nonlinear GaussMarquardt-Levenberg (GML) parameter estimation method and linked the GEOtop model to the Parameter ESTimation tool (PEST). Using this developed GEOtop-PEST interface, we particularly investigated the value added by including turbulent flux data in the parameter estimation process, and analyse the impact of the additional flux data on the uncertainty bounds of the parameters. To better understand the interplay of the model parameters and to identify the dominating parameters in the calibration process, we also conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We were able to identify a set of model parameters that reproduced both observed streamflow and turbulent heat fluxes reasonably well. The majority of the estimated parameters were highly sensitive to the considered variables. We showed that the confidence bounds of estimated parameters are narrowed significantly when considering not only streamflow observations but also turbulent flux measurements in the calibration process. In this manner, correlations between estimated parameters could also be reduced.},

And the hydrological models play a very important role in simulating the complex system. However, there have not been effective methods for the model reliability and uncertainty analysis due to its complexity and difficulty. The uncertainties in hydrological modeling come from four important aspects: uncertainties in input data and parameters, uncertainties in model structure, uncertainties in analysis method and the initial and boundary conditions. This paper systematically reviewed the recent advances in the study of the uncertainty analysis approaches in the large-scale complex hydrological model on the basis of uncertainty sources. Also, the shortcomings and insufficiencies in the uncertainty analysis for complex hydrological models are pointed out. And then a new uncertainty quantification platform PSUADE and its uncertainty quantification methods were introduced, which will be a powerful tool and platform for uncertainty analysis of large-scale complex hydrological models. Finally, some future perspectives on uncertainty quantification are put forward.},

  abstract = {The 3D information of a secondary flow evolved in curved or confluent channels, which is usually lost in conventional shallow water models due to the depth-averaging process, can be partially retrieved by incorporating the secondary current velocity profile in the vertical direction. In the present study, the depth-averaged shallow water equations with dispersion stresses were solved by the SU/PG scheme among the various numerical methods of the FEM. In the proposed model, to quantify the strength of the secondary flow, the comprehensive factors such as the deformation of the vertical profile of the streamwise velocity, the roughness coefficient, and the curvature ratio were embedded into the dispersion stress terms. Two sets of experimental data, one with a sharply curved channel by Rozovskii (1961) [40], and the other with a confluent channel by Shumate (1998) [51] were used to validate the proposed model. The computed values of the water surface profile and the depth-averaged velocity across the channel showed good agreement with experimental data, which indicated that secondary velocity profiles were preserved properly. The proposed model was applied to a natural stream with moderate curvature to test the field applicability. The simulation results obtained by the proposed model with dispersion terms matched quite well with the ADCP data, whereas the model without dispersion terms produced excessive velocities at both banks, and the commercial RMA-2 model yielded uniform spanwise velocity distributions at all sections. The analysis of the momentum balance and relative dominance of the secondary current demonstrated that the convection and pressure gradient terms played major roles in achieving equilibrium in momentum equations, and the bottom friction ranked next, followed by the remaining dispersion stresses and viscous term of a similar order. It was also found that the pressure gradient term was the primary factor that triggered velocity redistribution. As the Fr increased, the convective acceleration that formed along the channel curvature was activated as a secondary factor in velocity redistribution, whereas the viscous stress term lost its influence. The bottom friction term had minor exertion on the redistribution mechanism.},

  abstract = {Water and energy are the two key aspects driving economic and social development of a region. River impoundments are important structures for providing water, in case of domestic use, irrigation or mining and for providing energy as in the case of hydropower. The human interference in the riverine systems for creating these reservoirs is accompanied with several drawbacks. One and most important: ecosystem disruption. The reservoirs, which cause the disruption of a river continuum, also suffer from it by having a limited lifetime. Rivers are dynamic systems, which transport large amounts of organic and mineral material from the mountains until the sea. When they are impounded, this continuum is divided and the reservoir becomes the first sink of the particles. In order to plan remediation measures, a major scientific and engineering challenge is the assessment of sediment amounts that reach the reservoir in a certain time. The sediment volume/mass can be assessed via either the monitoring and modelling of sediment input from the hydrological catchment or, by measurements of the sediment volume in the reservoir. In the first case the spatial and temporal scale in which sediment mobilization takes place in the watershed, in addition to the episodic nature of sediment formation, make it difficult to derive reliable assessments of sediment input. On the other hand, the underwater environment and the spatial extent of the reservoir contributes also in the lack of reliable results concerning volumetric assessment of sediment. This study aims at a better assessment of both aspects of sediment input and reservoirs' sediment accumulation. The first part of this thesis deals with the quantification of erosion and sediment input from a watershed via modelling. The rapid population growth in many regions has dictated intense land use and landcover changes. These imply the usage of more dynamic models. Technological advancements in satellite imagery make it possible to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of the models but the overall effects of the integration of this data on the results are still not fully investigated. For assessing the improvement due to the technological advancement, the case of Passa{\'u}na catchment, located in southeast Brazil was examined. For this catchment, it was possible to quantify the sediment input and soil loss interanual dynamics in a monthly timestep, and to evaluate to what extent the inclusion of freely available satellite imagery can improve the modelling results. In other words, the integration of freely available Sentinel 2 satellite data made it possible to reduce the time and spatial resolution in comparison to the existing similar approaches. The second part of the thesis deals with the quantification of the sediment volume in the Passa{\'u}na reservoir. In this study, five different remote sensing as well as conventional and proxy sediment sampling techniques are integrated for increasing the accuracy of sediment volume assessment. At the end, an accurate assessment of the sediment volume in the reservoir was iv achieved. In addition, a guiding diagram to choose the most suitable sediment detection method, depending on sediment characteristic (sediment magnitude and biochemical activity) was derived. The results of both sections are closely related as the sediment input from a watershed is also the sediment amount that should be found in a reservoir like Passa{\'u}na where the trapping efficiency is {\textasciitilde}100\%. In this case, there is a difference of almost 50\% between the modelled sediment input and the sediment stock in the reservoir. The most important factors contributing in this discrepancy are the non-inclusion of gully-channel erosion in the sediment input model, errors in the calculation process, internal production of the reservoir, and errors in the measuring process. In overall based on the results of this thesis, the most important findings consist in the successful integration of freely available satellite imagery in a modelling approach to improve the sediment input assessment, and the combination of several methods for an accurate assessment of reservoir siltation. The findings of this thesis can contribute in bridging the gap between the two aspects of sediment budget by initially achieving an accurate reservoirs' sediment stock assessment and secondly by quantifying the discrepancy of each contributing factor for a case study.}

  abstract = {Spawning habitat utilized by Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) and Sea Trout (Salmo trutta) was characterized in a 1.6-km reach of the Newmills Burn, a small, highly canalized tributary of the River Don in Aberdeenshire. The Newmills Burn is typical of the intensively farmed lower sub-catchments of the major salmon rivers on the east coast of Scotland. Such streams have substantial potential in providing spawning and juvenile habitat for salmonids, with high redd densities resulting in egg deposition rates of {$>$} 5 m2. However, in comparison with upland spawning tributaries draining less intensively managed catchments, canalization and intensive cultivation has seriously degraded the physical characteristics of aquatic habitats in many streams. In the Newmills Burn, spawning gravels have a relatively high ({$>$} 20\% by mass) fine sediment ({$<$} 2 mm in size) content. The burn is characterized by hydraulic conditions that are suitable for salmonid spawning, with modal velocities of 0.50-0.65 m s(-1) and depths of 0.20-0.25 m. However, infiltration of fine sediments into gravels is rapid during hydrological events in the winter months. Thus, complete siltation of open gravel matrices (simulated redds) can occur within a week, and probably within a single moderate to large storm event. Appreciable, but small, deposition of organic and silt/clay particles can also affect spawning gravels. Egg mortalities in redds following spawning are variable, but can be as high as 86\% in the Newmills Burn. This may be related to fine sediment infiltration, reduced permeability of spawning gravels and reduced oxygen supply to ova. It appears that the main cause of high influx is sediment loads mobilized from intensively managed land. It is suggested that fundamental changes to the management of agricultural land is required if fish habitats are to be improved and degraded streams are allowed to re-naturalize. The need for closely focused investigations of the causal relationships between fine sediment infiltration and egg survival is stressed.},

The original particle swarm optimization algorithm was developed as an unconstrained optimization technique, which lacks a model that is able to handle constrained optimization problems. The particle swarm optimization and its inapplicability in constrained optimization problems are solved using the dynamic-objective constraint-handling method. The dynamic-objective constraint-handling method is originally developed for two variants of the basic particle swarm optimization, namely restricted velocity particle swarm optimization and self-adaptive velocity particle swarm optimization. Also on the subject velocity-type class, a review of three other variants is given, specifically: (1) vertical particle swarm optimization; (2) velocity limited particle swarm optimization; and (3) particle swarm optimization with scape velocity. These velocity-type particle swarm optimization variants all have in common a velocity parameter which determines the direction/movements of the particles.},

Survival was not significantly related (P {$>$} 0.05) to the percentage of sediments smaller than 2.0 mm in diameter, the geometric-mean particle size, or fredle indices of substrate quality. However, survival strongly depended on the mean dissolved oxygen content and velocity of groundwater in redds. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were not related (P {$>$} 0.05) to measures of substrate size composition, and these variables accounted for only a limited proportion of the variance among redds in seepage velocities. These factors account for the lack of any significant association between survival and substrate size composition.

However its initial formulation, denoted DES97 from here on, can exhibit an incorrect behavior in thick boundary layers and shallow separation regions. This behavior begins when the grid spacing parallel to the wall {$\Delta\parallel$} becomes less than the boundary-layer thickness {$\delta$}, either through grid refinement or boundary-layer thickening. The grid spacing is then fine enough for the DES length scale to follow the LES branch (and therefore lower the eddy viscosity below the RANS level), but resolved Reynolds stresses deriving from velocity fluctuations (``LES content'') have not replaced the modeled Reynolds stresses. LES content may be lacking because the resolution is not fine enough to fully support it, and/or because of delays in its generation by instabilities. The depleted stresses reduce the skin friction, which can lead to premature separation.},

  abstract = {Microalgal biostabilisation of cohesive sediments via the production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) has been well documented in intertidal ecosystems and represents a key ecosystem service with respect to the regulation of sediment transport. However, recent ecosystem comparison studies have uncovered a paradox in which sediment stability is commonly observed to be lower in freshwater ecosystems (compared with estuarine ecosystems) even though sediment EPS concentrations and microalgal biomass are high. Using a combination of freshwater and estuarine field and mesocosm techniques, the relative and interactive roles of salinity and the production of EPS (carbohydrate concentration) by benthic microalgae in the mediation of sediment stability in the Eden River catchment (river, mudflat and saltmarsh) were assessed. Sediment stability apparently increased with salinity from river (42.43 N m(-2) surface stagnation pressure; salinity 0) to mudflat (98.65 N m(-2); salinity 25) to saltmarsh (135.48 N m(-2); salinity 46). The opposite trend was observed in sediment chlorophyll a and carbohydrate concentrations, indicating that salinity is the main variable driving sediment stability across the ecosystems under moderate EPS concentrations. Observations from mesocosm experiments highlighted the individual and combined importance of salinity and EPS in biostabilisation, with the largest increase in sediment stability observed following combined additions (25-fold increase compared with the control). The biogeochemical processes responsible, and their role in buffering phosphorus transport across the freshwater-saltwater transitional zone, are discussed.},

This paper develops a novel methodology for large-scale ({$>$}1000 km2) hydrological model calibration and validation using stable water isotopes founded on the rigorous constraints imposed by the need to conserve both water mass and stable isotopes simultaneously. The isoWATFLOOD model is applied to five basins within the Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories region of northern Canada to simulate stream discharge and oxygen-18 signals over a 3-year period. The isotopic variation of river discharge, runoff components, and evaporative fractionation are successfully simulated on both a seasonal and continual basis over the watershed domain to demonstrate the application of isotope tracers to regional hydrologic calibration. The intended application of this research is to remote, large-scale basins, showing promise for improving predictions in minimally gauged basins and climate change research where traditional, rigorous approaches to constraining parameter uncertainty may be impractical. This coupled isotope-hydrological (i.e. iso-hydrological) approach to modelling reduces the number of possible parameterizations, resulting in potentially more physically-based hydrological predictions. isoWATFLOOD provides a tool for water resource managers and utilities to use operationally for water use, allocation, and runoff generation estimations.

  abstract = {Aquatic biological communities have directly undergone human-induced changes. Altered hydrological and morphological processes in running waters have caused the degradation of main habitats for biotas and have disturbed ecosystem functionality. The latest advances in river restoration concerned the rise in far-reaching hydromorphological restoration actions that have been implemented below dams to reverse well-known negative impacts of anthropogenic pressures. Some authors emphasized the enhancement of sediment supply and habitat diversity using gravel augmentation or bank erosion to restore morphodynamics, and thus improve biodiversity. We explored the Web of Science database for empirical research papers that specifically addressed such hydromorphological river restoration actions. Articles were examined using a text-content analysis tool to determine the major concepts or ideas they deal with. It has also been proved as useful in defining interrelationships and degree of interdisciplinary. Results showed that a low number of published scientific articles exist about such projects, mainly condensed in the North hemisphere. Divergent ecological issues were highlighted by the word co-occurrence networks: (i) gravel augmentation was used to improve spawning habitats for fish of economic interest whereas (ii) erodible corridor was designed to safeguard natural riparian systems, approaching morphological goals of channel widening. Overall, ecological responses were consistent with those expected, leading however rather to functional shifts than richness increase. Gravel augmentation or bank erosion were not usually combined with in-channel structure management. However, this might be an option to consider since the biological communities seem to be sensitive during first restorations with such combination. This review demonstrates the value of word co-occurrence networks in exploring a high number of previous publications, keys for formulating guidance to manage gravel augmentation or bank erosion along ecological purposes.},

  abstract = {The geometry and hydrodynamics of river reaches are key ecohydraulic descriptors. Statistics of water depth and velocity measurements are usually taken as proxies for habitat suitability in rivers. However, little is known about the sufficiency of data to produce effective and representative results. In this research, 19 reaches with differences in terms of discharge, river width, substrate, reach length, cross-section spacing and geomorphology are investigated. Measurements of flow depth and velocity were taken at multiple, equally spaced cross-sections along each reach. Data were sub-sampled using different methodologies and analysed each time. The sets of sub-sampled data were then compared with those calculated with the full data set from a reach. The focus was put towards the hydro-morphological index of diversity (HMID), a combination of the classical ecohydraulic variables flow depth and velocity. It represents the spatial variability of hydraulic habitats in a reach. The results point out that, with a well-defined sampling strategy, 100 measurement points lead to a good estimation of the HMID value in a reach, if more than eight measurement points are taken per cross-section. For geomorphologies with small complexity or when the analysis only includes the estimation of mean flow depth or mean flow velocity, this number can be decreased according to the results presented here. These findings help both, aquatic ecologists and engineers to estimate their data reliability for hydraulic field measurements in a river reach and are herein discussed taking into account the different studied morphologies.},

  abstract = {Dams store water and trap sediment in their reservoirs. Downstream river segments, hence, are affected by a limited sediment dynamics. This becomes obvious by river bed incision, limited geomorphological variability and depletion of hydraulic habitats for in-stream ecological organisms. Replenishment is a measure to counteract the lack of sediment. In segments dams such a sediment replenishment can be combined with the release of an artificial flood, by activating spillways and bottom outlets. Recent laboratory studies revealed the potential of multi-deposit replenishment configuration towards an increase of geomorphological richness in the river. However, this has not yet been tested in the field. The hydro-morphological index of diversity (HMID), is based on the spatial variability flow depth and velocity in a river segment, allowing the quantification of the change in morphology such a measure. Its ease in computation and its objectivity makes the index a useful tool for a large variety of users. However, knowledge concerning data sufficiency and a standardized sampling procedure does not exist. Further, the HMID does not account for temporal variability. This research aims at closing these gaps of knowledge for a sustainable management of complex floodplains downstream of dams. Flow depth and velocity data from 19 river segments were analyzed with the HMID. Structured sub-sampling and analysis of the data revealed different data sufficiency depending on the complexity of the river geomorphology. A representative HMID value is computed from at least 100 datapoints distributed over eight cross-sections, in braided rivers more datapoints are required. The geomorphological changes by an artificial flood event in the Sarine were analyzed with the HMID. In the impact perimeter of the multi-deposit sediment replenishment, the HMID increased by 36 \% in the Sarine, in the rest of the river 18 \%. A similar study was investigated at the Sp{\"o}l, pointing out that sediment availability is crucial for the hydraulic habitat diversity. With the help of 489 tracer stones, the movement of the replenished sediment was investigated in detail. The deposition pattern results in repeating sediment clusters on the riverbed, as it was observed in the laboratory experiments. For the two characteristic diameters, the tracers allowed the estimation of transport velocities of 19 cm/min (dm = 57 mm) and 28 cm/min (d90 = 113 mm) during the flood event and consequently the erosion efficiency of the different parts of the flood hydrograph. Macroinvertebrates were less affected by the artificial flood event in the hydropeaking river segment of the Sarine compared with the residual flow segment. The species diversity indices decreased significantly due to the artificial flood event. A direct link between flow regime and EPT richness was observed. A river with a natural flow regime hosts the highest richness of macroinvertebrates followed the residual and finally the hydropeaking flow regime. For other ecological indicators, additional physical river parameters for example the frequency duration curve or the grain size distribution need to be considered as well.},

  abstract = {The properties and behavior of intertidal marine sediments cannot be understood without taking their biology into account. Biological factors are important for the stability and erosion threshold of intertidal sediments as well as for sediment transport. In this paper I focus on intertidal sediments that are colonized and dominated by phototrophic microorganisms and their impact on the morphodynamics and sediment stabilization. The emphasis is on epipelic diatoms. These organisms exude copious amounts of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that may contribute to the stability of the sediment by gluing and binding. I review the factors that lead to the development of such microphytobenthic communities and the processes that lead to the exudation of EPS and its fate in intertidal mudflats. Epipelic diatoms exude EPS partly as the result of unbalanced growth. Extraction of EPS from cultures of epipelic diatoms yields two operational fractions. While one fraction contains largely neutral EPS, which may serve as a carbon-and energy reserve for the organism, the other is acidic and more recalcitrant to degradation. The latter EPS fraction is therefore predominant in the muddy sediment and may be responsible for increasing the erosion threshold. However, since extracted EPS alone is incapable of increasing the erosion threshold, diatoms are apparently actively involved in the structuring of the biofilm matrix. Therefore, sediment stabilization cannot be attributed simply to EPS alone. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {Building animation tools for fluid-like motions is an important and challenging problem with many applications in computer graphics. The use of physics-based models for fluid flow can greatly assist in creating such tools. Physical models, unlike key frame or procedural based techniques, permit an animator to almost effortlessly create interesting, swirling fluid-like behaviors. Also, the interaction of flows with objects and virtual forces is handled elegantly. Until recently, it was believed that physical fluid models were too expensive to allow real-time interaction. This was largely due to the fact that previous models used unstable schemes to solve the physical equations governing a fluid. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an unconditionally stable model which still produces complex fluid-like flows. As well, our method is very easy to implement. The stability of our model allows us to take larger time steps and therefore achieve faster simulations. We have used our model in conjuction with advecting solid textures to create many fluid-like animations interactively in two- and three-dimensions.},

We apply 3H-EMC in the Sperchios River in Central Greece, in which water abstractions for irrigation cause significant environmental impacts. Calculations of the hydrodynamic-habitat model, in which the large and the small chub are the main fish species, suggest discharge values that range from 1.0~m3/s to 4.0~m3/s. However, hydrological modelling indicates that it is practically difficult to achieve discharges that are higher than approximately 1.0{\textendash}1.5~m3/s. Furthermore, legislation suggests significantly lower values (0.4{\textendash}0.5~m3/s) that are unacceptable from the ecological point of view. This behaviour shows that a non-integrated approach, which is based only on hydrodynamic-habitat modelling does not necessarily result in realistic environmental flows, and thus an integrated approach is required. We propose the value of 1.0~m3/s as the ``optimum'' environmental flow for Sperchios River, because (a) it satisfies the habitat requirements, as expressed by the values of weighted useable area that are equal to 2180 and 1964~m2 for the large and small chub, respectively, and correspond to 82 and 95\% of their respective maximum values, (b) it is consistent with the requirements of Environmental Classes A and B, whose percentiles are higher than 75\% for discharge (77.2\%) and for habitat availability ({$>$}83.5\% for the large chub and {$>$}85.0\% for the small chub), (c) it is practically achievable from the hydrological point of view, and (d) it is higher than the value proposed by the Greek legislation. The proposed modelling approach can be applied to any river or stream using the same or similar modelling tools, which should be linked via suitable coupling algorithms.},

  abstract = {In the present work, we verified a 3D computational fluid dynamics model for vertical slot fish-passes (VSFs) that employs the renormalization-group k-epsilon turbulence model (RNG KE) and the volume of fluid (VOF) method. We compared model calculations with experiments in two pool designs T1 and T2 of an experimental VSF and with 2D calculations using the shallow water equations (SWE) and the standard k-epsilon (2D SKE) model. Calculations of the 3D model showed (1) good agreement with experiments and 2D calculations in predicting mean flow velocities, (2) better performance in the determination of the water surface in the VSF, which is attributed to the accurate VOF method, (3) superior prediction of turbulence characteristics than the 2D model, which is due to the 3D RNG KE model that overcomes the problem of turbulence overestimation of the 2D SKE model, and to the fact that the 3D model takes into account the 3D features of the flow in the fish pass. Moreover, the present 3D calculations showed that the common assumptions in VSFs that (1) the flow is 2D, and (2) the simulation of 4 pools of a VSF is sufficient to obtain satisfactory results, are not always valid. Flow can be considered as 2D only in pool design T2 and for certain geometries and flow characteristics in pool design T1; while, eventually, all the pools of a fish pass need to be modeled to ensure accurate results. Finally, the present work illustrates the need to perform fish experiments simultaneously with flow experiments.},

Our solution procedure originates from the fully-unsteady matrix-vector formulation developed in [54]. The principal part of the problem is solved by an explicit Finite Volume upwind method of the path-conservative type, by which all the variables are updated simultaneously in a coupled fashion. The solution to the principal part is embedded into a splitting procedure for the treatment of frictional source terms. The numerical scheme is extended to second-order accuracy and includes a bookkeeping procedure for handling the evolution of size stratification in the substrate. We develop a concept of balancedness for the vertical mass flux between the substrate and active layer under bed degradation, which prevents the occurrence of non-physical oscillations in the grainsize distribution of the substrate. We suitably modify the numerical scheme to respect this principle. We finally verify the accuracy in our solution to the equations, and its ability to reproduce one-dimensional morphodynamics due to streamwise and vertical sorting, using three test cases. In detail, (i) we empirically assess the balancedness of vertical mass fluxes under degradation; (ii) we study the convergence to the analytical linearised solution for the propagation of infinitesimal-amplitude waves [54], which is here employed for the first time to assess a mixed-sediment model; (iii) we reproduce Ribberink{\dbend}s E8-E9 flume experiment [46].},

  abstract = {Thoughtful leaders increasingly recognize that we are not only failing to solve the persistent problems we face, but are in fact causing them. System dynamics is designed to help avoid such policy resistance and identify high-leverage policies for sustained improvement. What does it take to be an effective systems thinker, and to teach system dynamics fruitfully? Understanding complex systems requires mastery of concepts such as feedback, stocks and flows, time delays, and nonlinearity. Research shows that these concepts are highly counterintuitive and poorly understood. It also shows how they can be taught and learned. Doing so requires the use of formal models and simulations to test our mental models and develop our intuition about complex systems. Yet, though essential, these concepts and tools are not sufficient. Becoming an effective systems thinker also requires the rigorous and disciplined use of scientific inquiry skills so that we can uncover our hidden assumptions and biases. It requires respect and empathy for others and other viewpoints. Most important, and most difficult to learn, systems thinking requires understanding that all models are wrong and humility about the limitations of our knowledge. Such humility is essential in creating an environment in which we can learn about the complex systems in which we are embedded and work effectively to create the world we truly desire.

  abstract = {Streambed hydraulic conductivity is an important control on flow within the hyporheic zone, affecting hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical processes essential to river ecosystem function. Despite many published field measurements, few empirical studies examine the drivers of spatial and temporal variations in streambed hydraulic conductivity. Reach-averaged hydraulic conductivity estimated for 119 surveys in 83 stream reaches across continental France, even of coarse bed streams, are shown to be characteristic of sand and finer sediments. This supports a model where processes leading to the accumulation of finer sediments within streambeds largely control hydraulic conductivity rather than the size of the coarse bed sediment fraction. After describing a conceptual model of relevant processes, we fit an empirical model relating hydraulic conductivity to candidate geomorphic and hydraulic drivers. The fitted model explains 72\% of the deviance in hydraulic conductivity (and 30\% using an external cross-validation). Reach hydraulic conductivity increases with the amplitude of bedforms within the reach, the bankfull channel width-depth ratio, stream power and upstream catchment erodibility but reduces with time since the last streambed disturbance. The correlation between hydraulic conductivity and time since a streambed mobilisation event is likely a consequence of clogging processes. Streams with a predominantly suspended load and less frequent streambed disturbances are expected to have a lower streambed hydraulic conductivity and reduced hyporheic fluxes. This study suggests a close link between streambed sediment transport dynamics and connectivity between surface water and the hyporheic zone.},

  abstract = {Turbulent flow in a meandering channel is computed with two Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes solving the Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations by employing different turbulence closure approaches. The first CFD code solves the steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations (RANS) using an isotropic turbulence closure. The second code is based on the concept of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). LES resolves the large-scale turbulence structures in the flow and is known to outperform RANS models in flows in which large-scale structures dominate the statistics. The results obtained from the two codes are compared with experimental data from a physical model study. Both, LES and RANS simulation, predict the primary helical flow pattern in the meander as well as the occurrence of an outer-bank secondary cell. Computed primary as well as secondary flow velocities are in reasonably good agreement with experimental data. Evidence is given that the outer-bank secondary cell in a meander bend is the residual of the main secondary cell of the previous bend. However, the RANS code, regardless of the turbulence model employed, overpredicts the size and strength of the outer-bank secondary cell. Furthermore, only LES is able to uphold the outer-bank second secondary cell beyond the bend apex until the exit of the bend as turbulence anisotropy contributes to its persistence. The presence of multiple secondary cells has important consequences for the distribution of shear stresses along the wetted perimeter of the channel, and thereby the sediment transport in meandering channels. Consequently, even though LES is expected to compute the bed-shear stresses along the wetted perimeter of the channel with a higher degree of accuracy than the RANS model, comparisons between LES and RANS computed wall shear stresses agree well. These findings are useful for practitioners who need to rely on RANS model predictions of the flow in meandering channels at field scale.},

  abstract = {It is necessary to improve our understanding of the exchange of dissolved constituents between surface and subsurface waters in river systems in order to better evaluate the fate of water-borne contaminants and nutrients and their effects on water quality and aquatic ecosystems. Here we present a model that can predict hyporheic exchange at the bed-form-to-reach scale using readily measurable system characteristics. The objective of this effort was to compare subsurface flow induced at scales ranging from very small scale bed forms up to much larger planform geomorphic features such as meanders. In order to compare exchange consistently over this range of scales, we employed a spectral scaling approach as the basis for a generalized analysis of topography-induced stream-subsurface exchange. The spectral model involves a first-order approximation for local flow-boundary interactions but is fully three-dimensional and includes the lateral hyporheic zone in addition to the flow directly beneath the streambed. The primary model input parameters are stream velocity and slope, sediment permeability and porosity, and detailed measurements of the stream channel topography. The primary outputs are the distribution of water flux across the stream channel boundary, the resulting pore water flow paths, and the subsurface residence time distribution. We tested the bed-form-exchange component of the model using a highly detailed two-dimensional data set for exchange with ripples and dunes and then applied the model to a three-dimensional meandering stream in a laboratory flume. Having spatially explicit information allowed us to evaluate the contributions of both gravitational and current-driven hyporheic flow through various classes of stream channel features including ripples, dunes, bars, and meanders. The model simulations indicate that all scales of topography between ripples and meanders have a significant effect on pore water flow fields and residence time distributions. Furthermore, complex interactions across the spectrum of topographic features play an important role in controlling the net interfacial flux and spatial distribution of hyporheic exchange. For example, shallow exchange induced by current-driven interactions with small bed forms dominates the interfacial flux, but local pore water flows are modified significantly by larger-scale surface-groundwater interactions. As a result, simplified representations of the stream topography do not adequately characterize patterns and rates of hyporheic exchange.},

  abstract = {Improved predictions of hyporheic exchange based on easily measured physical variables are needed to improve assessment of solute transport and reaction processes in watersheds. Here we compare physically based model predictions for an Indiana stream with stream tracer results interpreted using the Transient Storage Model (TSM). We parameterized the physically based, Multiscale Model (MSM) of stream-groundwater interactions with measured stream planform and discharge, stream velocity, streambed hydraulic conductivity and porosity, and topography of the streambed at distinct spatial scales (i.e., ripple, bar, and reach scales). We predicted hyporheic exchange fluxes and hyporheic residence times using the MSM. A Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) model was used to convert the MSM output into predictions of in stream solute transport, which we compared with field observations and TSM parameters obtained by fitting solute transport data. MSM simulations indicated that surface-subsurface exchange through smaller topographic features such as ripples was much faster than exchange through larger topographic features such as bars. However, hyporheic exchange varies nonlinearly with groundwater discharge owing to interactions between flows induced at different topographic scales. MSM simulations showed that groundwater discharge significantly decreased both the volume of water entering the subsurface and the time it spent in the subsurface. The MSM also characterized longer timescales of exchange than were observed by the tracer-injection approach. The tracer data, and corresponding TSM fits, were limited by tracer measurement sensitivity and uncertainty in estimates of background tracer concentrations. Our results indicate that rates and patterns of hyporheic exchange are strongly influenced by a continuum of surface-subsurface hydrologic interactions over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales rather than discrete processes.},

  abstract = {Variations in permeability have been found to significantly affect the flow of water though hyporheic systems, especially in regions with discontinuous transitions between distinct streambed lithologies. In this study, we probabilistically arranged two sediments (sand and sandy gravel) in a grid framework and imposed a single hyporheic flow cell across the grid to investigate how discontinuous permeability fields influence volumetric flow and residence time distributions. We used both a physical system and computer simulations to model flow through this sediment grid. A solution of blue dye and salt was pumped into the system and used to detect flow. We recorded the dye location using time-lapse photography and measured the electrolytic conductivity levels as the water exited the system as a proxy for salt concentration. We also used a computer simulation to calculate dye-fronts, residence times, and exiting salt concentrations for the modeled system. Comparison between simulations and physical measurements yielded strong agreement. In further simulations with 300 different grids, we found a strong correlation between volumetric flow rate and the placement of high permeability grid cells in regions of high hydraulic head gradients. One implication is that small anomalies in streambed permeability have a disproportionately large influence on hyporheic flows when located near steep head gradients such as steps. We also used moving averages with varying window sizes to investigate the effect of the abruptness of transitions between sediment types. We found that smoother permeability fields increased the volumetric flow rate and decreased the median residence times.},

Many different methods are available, but all have limitations. Some destroy the natural sediment structure, others lack a small-scale resolution, and all fail to determine anisotropy. In this study, we present a new measuring approach to determine hydraulic conductivity (K) and anisotropy at a detailed scale. Frozen, undisturbed sediment samples taken with the freeze-core technique form the basis of our approach. Orientated core cutter samples are taken from the freeze-cores at different depths and examined by means of falling-head lab permeameter tests, in order to obtain detailed profiles of vertical and horizontal K values and anisotropy. The approach was tested with natural sediment samples from the bed of a channel near Potsdam, Germany, and with samples from an experimental container. For comparison and evaluation, hydraulic conductivities were also determined by means of in situ permeameter tests and empirically, on the basis of grain-size distribution (GSD). The results show a large discrepancy between the empirically determined hydraulic conductivities and the directly measured hydraulic conductivity with lab and in situ permeameter tests. We conclude that empirical methods based on GSD are not suitable for determining in situ conductivity of river bed sediments. Our new approach enables an improved geohydraulic characterization of river bed sediments including the determination of anisotropy.},

Using values from literature and excavations, this study examined rooting patterns for 125 riparian species of southwestern USA and asked if maximum root depth varies with 1) moisture affinity, 2) growth habit, 3) flowering season, and 4) exotic vs. native status. Root depth varied with all factors analyzed. Hydroriparian species had shallower roots than mesoriparian and xeroriparian species. Annuals had shallower roots than perennials, and shrubs had deeper roots than trees. Hydroriparian perennials and cool-season annuals had the shallowest roots; xeroriparian shrubs had the deepest. Plants varied widely in root depth as well as in root length (near surface laterals) and root:shoot ratios. This wide range is typical of ecosystems that have many water sources, with each rooting pattern being adaptive in a different hydrogeomorphic setting. Exotic species showed trait divergence as evidenced by greater rooting depths. There were many data gaps, with several species having no rooting data. There is a need for site-based studies of rooting patterns in dryland riparian zones to more accurately document hydrogeomorphic niches and predict changes in plant distributions.},

The influence on local scour patterns due to hydraulic parameters such as the Froude number, the slope of the protection wall, the width of the protection apron along the outside wall of the downstream section, and the grain size of the channel bed material is examined. Protection-wall slopes ranging from 1:0.5 to 1:4 (vertical to horizontal) were investigated, as were different widths of the protection apron; the goal was to ascertain the role of these variables in local scour patterns in the vicinity of the bend. The factors affecting local scour depth are related through empirical equations to key hydraulic variables, the slope of the protection wall, and the width of the protection apron.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on sediment bypass tunnels for reservoir sedimentation management. Worldwide, number of constructed sediment bypass tunnels is very small because of topographical, hydrological or economical conditions. Bypass tunnels, however, have many advantages such as they can be constructed even at existing dams and prevent a loss of stored reservoir water caused by the lowering of the reservoir water level. They are also considered to have a relatively small impact on environment downstream because inflow discharge can pass through tunnels very naturally during flood times. In Japan, sediment bypass tunnels of the Nunobiki Dam completed in 1908, and of the Asahi Dam completed in 1995, have been successfully introduced to realize sustainable reservoir management. Sediment bypasses of the Miwa Dam, Koshibu Dam and Matsukawa Dam on the Tenryu River are expected to be next leading projects in Japan. In this paper, we discuss design criteria and lessons learned from existing facilities, and future challenges of planning projects. The focus is on tunnel geometries such as diameter, slope, bottom shape etc., and an abrasion-resistance design of the tunnel invert.}

The results showed that both the content and the composition of the SOM changed, with total SOM content decreasing. The content of humic acid (HA) was reduced, while the content of humin did not change significantly, however the content of fulvic acid (FA) had a tendency to increase. Correlation analysis of soil{\textendash}water distribution coefficient (Kd) and different parts of the SOM reveals that humin and HA are the key factors controlling the sorption of pyrene. Organic carbon normalized Kd (KOC) varied to different extents after Fenton oxidation due to the change of SOM composition. The reduction of KOC is significant in Soils 1 and 2 where large part of HA was reduced to FA, whose sorption ability is low. The change of KOC by oxidation in Soil 3 is not so significant due to that the percentage of humin and HA in Soil 3 did not change greatly after oxidation. Desorption was hysteretic in all cases, and humin percentage was found to be the key factor on the extent of desorption hystersis. Oxidation made desorption more hysteretic due to the elevated proportion of humin.},

This model comprises a depth-integrated hydrodynamic sub-model for rapidly varying unsteady flows and a bed load sediment transport sub-model for non-uniform sediments. The sheltering effects of non-uniform particles and the lateral sediment transport due to bed slope and secondary flow are taken into account in the sediment sub-model. Channel bed level change is calculated according to the erosion/deposition rate, and the bank movement is modelled according to the submerged angle of repose, which is valid for braided rivers in natural and experimental conditions. The model has been applied to a braided river produced in a flume experiment, and the numerical model-predicted channel patterns are shown to generally well resemble the experimental river. Most of the morphodynamic processes observed in the experiment can be found in the numerical predictions, including the evolution of the channel from a single straight channel to a multi-thread pattern and local morphologic changes. The mechanisms of the morphodynamic evolution of multi-thread flows are investigated, in which the process of grain sorting occurs under the interaction of fluid and sand, and the effect on channel migration is identified.},

The model takes into account the key processes of channel migration, including bed deformation, bank failure and wetting and drying. Secondary flows in bends play an important role in lateral sediment transport, which further affects channel migration. A new formula has been derived to predict the near-bed secondary flow speed, in which the magnitude of the speed is linked to the lateral water level gradient. Since only non-cohesive sediment is considered in the current study, the bank failure is modelled based on the concept of submerged angle of repose. The wetting and drying process is modelled using an existing method. Comparisons between the numerical model predictions and experimental observations for various discharges have been made. It is found that the model predicted channel planform and cross-sectional shapes agree generally well with the laboratory observations. A scenario analysis is also carried out to investigate the impact of secondary flow on the channel migration process. It shows that if the effect of secondary flow is ignored, the channel size in the lateral direction will be seriously underestimated.},

We analyzed the discrepancies between the data sets from daily to annual timescales and found large differences in both the magnitude and the variability of precipitation estimates. The magnitude of annual precipitation estimates over global land deviated by as much as 300 mm/yr among the products. Reanalysis data sets had a larger degree of variability than the other types of data sets. The degree of variability in precipitation estimates also varied by region. Large differences in annual and seasonal estimates were found in tropical oceans, complex mountain areas, northern Africa, and some high-latitude regions. Overall, the variability associated with extreme precipitation estimates was slightly greater at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes. The reliability of precipitation data sets is mainly limited by the number and spatial coverage of surface stations, the satellite algorithms, and the data assimilation models. The inconsistencies described limit the capability of the products for climate monitoring, attribution, and model validation.},

We summarize typical SSC changes and propose a new sediment modeling framework for heavily dammed fluvial systems with the Changjiang (Yangtze River) as a background. We find that the fluvial SSC has declined by an order of magnitude, i.e., from {$\sim$}1.0 to {$\sim$}0.1 kg/m3, and even to {$\sim$}0.01 kg/m3 locally. The SSC distribution pattern along the mainstream has changed remarkably, with the sediment source/sink being partially reversed. Downstream of the Three Gorges Dam, the SSC recovery capacity gradually decreases with the sediment erosion quantity accumulated over time, and the SSC contribution rate of a linked large lake (Dongting) will change from negative (ca. -39\%) to positive (ca. 17\%), in the coming decades.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the performance of numerical models of coastal morphology against observations is an essential part of establishing their credibility. In the past, this has usually been done by comparing predicted with observed behavior, and the modeler making a subjective judgement of the goodness of fit. By contrast, meteorological models have been tested for many years against observations using objective, scientifically rigorous methods. Drawing on the analogy between distributions of atmospheric pressure (and similar scalars) and coastal bathymetry, the meteorological statistical methods are here adapted to coastal applications. A set of criteria is proposed that identify the desirable attributes of statistical measures of the performance of coastal morphological models. Various statistical parameters used in the meteorological field are described, dealing both with cases in which the model outputs comprise a small number of categories (e.g., advance/equilibrium/retreat of shoreline), and those in which they are continuous (e.g., bathymetry). Examples of the application of these methods are given, in terms of both hypothetical illustrations, and real field data and model predictions. Following meteorological practice, it is shown that measuring the skill of a model (i.e., its performance relative to a simple baseline predictor) is a more critical test than measuring its absolute accuracy. The attributes of the different performance measures are compared with the proposed desirable criteria, and those that match them best are selected. These are the LEPSOB test for categorical data, and the Brier Skill Score (BSS) for continuous data. Routine use of these measures of performance would aid inter-comparability of models, and be a step toward strengthening user confidence in the predictions of coastal numerical models.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} High soil erosion and excessive sediment load are serious problems in several Himalayan river basins. To apply mitigation procedures, precise estimation of soil erosion and sediment yield with associated uncertainties are needed. Here, the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) equations are used to estimate the spatial pattern of soil erosion (SE) and sediment yield (SY) in the Garra River basin, a small Himalayan tributary of the River Ganga. A methodology is proposed for quantifying and propagating uncertainties in SE, SDR and SY estimates. Expressions for uncertainty propagation are derived by first-order uncertainty analysis, making the method viable even for large river basins. The methodology is applied to investigate the relative importance of different RUSLE factors in estimating the magnitude and uncertainties in SE over two distinct morphoclimatic regimes of the Garra River basin, namely the upper mountainous region and the lower alluvial plains. Our results suggest that average SE in the basin is very high (23\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;4.7\&thinsp;t\&thinsp;ha\textsuperscript{-1}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}) with higher values in the upper mountainous region (92\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;15.2\&thinsp;t\&thinsp;ha\textsuperscript{-1}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}) compared to the lower alluvial plains (19.3\&thinsp;{$\pm$}\&thinsp;4\&thinsp;t\&thinsp;ha\textsuperscript{-1}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}).

  abstract = {Numerous practical engineering applications can be formulated as non-convex, non-smooth, multi-modal and ill-conditioned optimization problems. Classical, deterministic algorithms require an enormous computational effort, which tends to fail as the problem size and its complexity increase, which is often the case. On the other hand, stochastic, biologically-inspired techniques, designed for global optimum calculation, frequently prove successful when applied to real life computational problems. While the area of bio-inspired algorithms (BIAs) is still relatively young, it is undergoing continuous, rapid development. Selection and tuning of the appropriate optimization solver for a particular task can be challenging and requires expert knowledge of the methods to be considered. Comparing the performance of viable candidates against a defined test bed environment can help in solving such dilemmas. This paper presents the benchmark results of two biologically inspired algorithms: covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) and two variants of particle swarm optimization (PSO). COCO (COmparing Continuous Optimizers) {\textendash} a platform for systematic and sound comparisons of real-parameter global optimization solvers was used to evaluate the performance of CMA-ES and PSO methods. Particular attention was paid to the efficiency and scalability of both techniques.},

  abstract = {Hydrologic and environmental models are useful for prediction and understanding of processes. Model calibration often faces the problem of equifinality, by which empirical observations validate one set of model parameter values almost to the same degree as another very different set. This uncertainty in model parameter values implies uncertainty in model predictions. A stochastic approach to calibration is therefore appropriate to establish the likely range or probability distribution of model parameters and predictions. In the literature, two commonly used methods are the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) approach and the Parameter Estimation (PEST) software (a nonlinear parameter estimation and optimization package). This study makes a side-by-side comparison of GLUE and PEST applied to two models, the first a simple two-parameter sinusoidal temperature model and the second a complex multi-parameter multi-purpose hydrologic model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, applied to the Salt Creek watershed in Illinois. The SWAT model is calibrated for stream flow, corn and soybean yields, and nitrate load. The GLUE and PEST calibrations for the simple model are straightforward. The same is not true, however, of the complex SWAT model, for which both GLUE and PEST are found to require some level of prior information to be effective. In this study, that information is obtained from a deterministic calibration of the system using a genetic algorithm (GA). The results indicate that generally there is a greater flexibility in problem specification in GLUE than in PEST. This is desirable, although it also means that there is a greater level of subjectivity. This flexibility, together with GLUE's independence from any assumption of model structure, makes GLUE suitable for calibrating large complex models where computational resources are available. On the other hand, for problems where the presence of local optima is not significant, PEST is an attractive option, as it is able to identify the optimal set of adjustable model parameters at just a fraction of the computational cost of GLUE.},

Here, the relationships of changes in extreme precipitation and flood intensities for the end of the twenty-first century with spatial and seasonal water availability are quantified. Results show an intensification of extreme precipitation and flood events over all climate regions which increases as water availability increases from dry to wet regions. Similarly, there is an increase in the intensification of extreme precipitation and flood with the seasonal cycle of water availability. The connection between extreme precipitation and flood intensity changes and spatial and seasonal water availability becomes stronger as events become less extreme.},

  abstract = {The cost-effective mitigation of climate change through nature-based carbon dioxide removal strategies has gained substantial policy attention. Inland and coastal wetlands (specifically boreal, temperate and tropical peatlands; tundra; floodplains; freshwater marshes; saltmarshes; and mangroves) are among the most efficient natural long-term carbon sinks. Yet, they also release methane (CH4) that can offset the carbon they sequester. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis on wetland carbon dynamics to (i) determine their impact on climate using different metrics and time horizons, (ii) investigate the cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation, and (iii) discuss their suitability for inclusion in climate policy as negative emission technologies. Depending on metrics, a wetland can simultaneously be a net carbon sink (i.e. boreal and temperate peatlands net ecosystem carbon budget = -28.1 {$\pm$} 19.13 gC m-2 y-1) but have a net warming effect on climate at the 100 years time-scale (i.e. boreal and temperate peatland sustained global warming potential = 298.2 {$\pm$} 100.6 gCO2 eq-1 m-2 y-1). This situation creates ambivalence regarding the effect of wetlands on global temperature. Moreover, our review reveals high heterogeneity among the (limited number of) studies that document wetland carbon budgets. We demonstrate that most coastal and inland wetlands have a net cooling effect as of today. This is explained by the limited CH4 emissions that undisturbed coastal wetlands produce, and the long-term carbon sequestration performed by older inland wetlands as opposed to the short lifetime of CH4 in the atmosphere. Analysis of wetland restoration costs relative to the amount of carbon they can sequester revealed that restoration is more cost-effective in coastal wetlands such as mangroves (US\$1800 ton C-1) compared with inland wetlands (US\$4200{\textendash}49 200 ton C-1). We advise that for inland wetlands, priority should be given to conservation rather than restoration; while for coastal wetlands, both conservation and restoration may be effective techniques for climate change mitigation.},

Conditions with prevailing bed-load transport, and conditions in which a significant part of the bed material is transported as suspended-load are studied. The effect of a sloping bed on the direction of sediment transport is determined by conducting bed-levelling experiments. Comparison of the results with data of curved flume experiments and experience gained with numerical computation of the bed topography in natural rivers yields the conclusion that, at least for bed-load transport, a distinction should be made between laboratory conditions and natural rivers. For conditions with suspended sediment transport the transverse slope effect can not be modelled identical as for bed-load transport.}

Still, sampling techniques differ greatly between studies and the influence of these differences is not fully understood. Thus, we evaluate the representativeness of manta trawling and pump sampling for microplastics in a freshwater lake. While large microplastics are not captured by most pump sampling approaches due to their low abundance, small and fibrous microplastics pass the relatively coarse nets of volume-reduced techniques. Testing different water volumes for pump samples, we show that sample volumes should be large enough to minimize overestimation induced by scaling up results. Moreover, we discuss the influence of sample numbers for microplastic analysis. Finally, we argue that manta trawling and pump sampling are complementary techniques, as they cover different parts of the overall microplastic pollution.},

Existing SY models have mostly been tested over a few small catchments in specific regions or in large river basins globally. By comparing the performance of eight well-known SY models in 454 small catchments with various land covers and uses across the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam, we identified the simple Morgan model for its better performance in representing the spatial variability of continental scale SY at spatial scales relevant to ESMs (several to hundreds of square kilometers) than other models because of a more realistic representation of runoff-driven erosion and sediment transport capacity in the context of current data availability. The results also indicated that runoff-driven erosion should be formulated using a power function of runoff, shear stress, or stream power to better represent the total effect of concentrated flow if gully erosion and channel erosion are not explicitly modeled. We also demonstrated that the Morgan model can be further improved by removing snowmelt-driven runoff in modeling runoff-driven erosion and to a minor degree by integrating a landslide model. The improved Morgan model explains 57\% of the spatial variability of the measured SY. The new model also demonstrated the capability to simulate SY in cross-validation catchments at fine temporal scales, which is important for coupling SY with other biogeochemistry processes in ESMs.},

  abstract = {RUSLE is one of the most widely used soil erosion model worldwide. However, some of the input parameters of RUSLE may require extensive field and laboratory studies, and therefore in most of the cases these parameters are estimated according to some alternative approaches. In this context, cover-management factor (C) has significant importance since it is the most influential factor due to its effect on result, besides; there are some doubts about the alternative approaches which are used to estimate the C factor. Moreover, although plenty of RUSLE applications in different areas are conducted in Turkey, any comprehensive study regarding the validation of obtained RUSLE results according to specific conditions is lacking. In this study, the drainage basin of the reservoir of Kartalkaya Dam which is in the south eastern part of Turkey was chosen as the study area, and the average annual eroded material was identified though RUSLE. For the mentioned reservoir area, the availability of bathymetry measurements for 30 years time span between 1975{\textendash}2005, provide the appropriate conditions to validate the results of the model since the deposited sediment volume could be quantified. Therefore, after the identification of the average annual eroded material for the sub-basins, SEDD model was applied in order to reveal the annual transported sediment amount within each sub-basin of the study area. The results obtained from the SEDD model were compared with the bathymetry measurements of the reservoir. In this context, the first objective of this study is to propose a new approach to estimate the C factor by using remote sensing and GIS techniques with previous studies based on experimental studies conducted on field. The second objective of the study is to estimate RUSLE parameters by using available datasets and to examine the applicability of the method on other basins in Turkey with same datasets. The third objective of the study is to estimate the transported sediment amount by using SEDD model, and by comparing its result with the bathymetry measurements of the reservoir to make a validation of both RUSLE and SEDD models.},

Dry mass concentration increased significantly with depth in the upper 2 mm and the structure of surface sediment changed visibly within a short distance of the surface. The upper 300 mu m of the sediment was highly porous but became compact by 4 mm. Epipelic diatoms and cyanobacteria were observed at high densities in the upper 300 mu m. In addition, the concentration of colloidal carbohydrates increased significantly in a landwards direction along a short transect. Furthermore, the distribution of sediment carbohydrates was apparently influenced by sediment bed morphology and these findings are discussed. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.},

  abstract = {Deposition of fine suspended particles can reduce hyporheic exchange flux (HEF), which may result in impairment of various ecological processes. However, the dynamics of fine particle deposition and streambed clogging are still not well understood, especially when the bed is in motion. We conducted flume experiments to study the effects of coupled sand-clay dynamics on HEF with episodic (pulse) inputs of suspended kaolinite. Three experiments with a mobile sand bed and constant discharge were conducted with repeated injection of suspended kaolinite pulses at fixed concentration increments of 0.16, 0.41, and 0.66 g/L, respectively. HEF and participating porewater volume were assessed using tracer tests. Kaolinite deposition rates were inferred from turbidity measurements while deposition patterns were measured using core samples. We found that fine sediment primarily accumulated within a layer below the bedform scour zone, and that this layer was thicker when kaolinite was added in larger pulses. HEF declined linearly over time as kaolinite accumulated in the bed sediment; an increase of 0.1\% kaolinite in the bed led to a decrease in HEF of 26.6 cm/day, regardless of the pulse concentration. However, the same kaolinite increase led to a reduction of 50\% in participating pore volume for larger kaolinite pulses, versus only 30\% for the smallest pulse. These results indicate that clogging occurs not just during and after high-flow events, but also under constant flow conditions in which episodic deposition of suspended clay by HEF leads to the formation of a low-conductivity layer in the bed.},

  abstract = {Soil loss causes environmental degradation and reduces agricultural productivity over large areas of the world. Here, we use the latest earth observation data and soil visibleenear infrared (viseNIR) spectroscopy to estimate the factors of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and to model soil loss by water erosion in Australia. We estimate rainfall erosivity (R) using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM); slope length and steepness (L and S) using a 3-arcsec Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model; cover management (C) and control practice (P) using the national dynamic land cover dataset (DLCD) of Australia derived from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS); and soil erodibility (K) using viseNIR estimates of the contents of sand, silt, clay and organic carbon in Australian soil. We model K using a machine-learning algorithm with environmental predictors selected to best capture the factors that influence erodibility and produced a digital map of K. We use the derived RUSLE factors to estimate soil loss at 1-km resolution across the whole of Australia. We found that the potential gross average soil loss by water erosion in Australian is 1.86 t ha{\`A}1 y{\`A}1 (95\% confidence intervals of 1.78 and 1.93 t ha{\`A}1 y{\`A}1), equivalent to a total of 1242 {\^A} 106 tonnes of soil lost annually (95\% confidence intervals of 1195 and 1293 t {\^A} 106 y{\`A}1). Our estimates of erosion are generally smaller than previous continental estimates using the RUSLE, but particularly in croplands, which might indicate that soil conservation practices effectively reduced erosion in Australia. However we also identify localized regions with large erosion in northern Australia and northeastern Queensland. Erosion in these areas carries sediments laden with nitrogen, phosphorus and pollutants from agricultural production into the sea, negatively affecting marine ecosystems. We used the best available data and our results provide better estimates compared to previous assessments. Our approach will be valuable for other large, sparsely sampled areas of the world where assessments of soil erosion are needed.},

Therefore, it is desired to forecast the dimensions of dunes during such extreme and unsteady flood events. At present it is not yet feasible to predict the dimensions of dunes by computing the flow and sediment transport in full detail for operational spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we present a morphodynamic model that simulates dune development, without computing all details in the flow field. The flow model is based on the 2D-vertical hydrostatic equations, with a constant eddy viscosity over depth. Flow separation and the sediment transport behaviour in the flow separation zone are included in a parameterized way. Results of the morphodynamic model using steady flow conditions, are in general agreement with flume experiments. A next step in the research will be to use forecasted dune dimensions for hydraulic roughness predictions.},

The aim of this paper is to gain some insight into how the momentum transport by cross-stream circulation contributes to the bed shear stress redistribution. Experimental analysis, based on a detailed dataset collected in a large-amplitude meandering laboratory flume, is presented. From these data an evaluation is made of the terms in the depth-averaged momentum equations and the analysis is especially devoted to terms including the momentum transport by cross-sectional motion. Results confirm that these terms exert an important role in bed shear stress estimation and, thus, they have to be adequately included in the depth-averaged models. Based on measured data, an equation expressing the interrelation between the cross-sectional momentum and the downstream velocity is also introduced.},

  abstract = {Sediment dynamics in river catchments are controlled by tectonics, climate, and biota effecting material production on hillslopes and transport of sediment from their source to the catchment outlet. Tectonics create topography and control erodibility of the bedrock material, whereas climate controls the efficiency of weathering and transporting processes. In contrast, the effects of biota (i.e. vegetation) are more ambiguous. Vegetation accelerates bio-chemical weathering and effects mass wasting through uprooting, trapping and stabilizing hillslope material. Furthermore, vegetation exerts a strong control on the grain size distribution of hillslope sediments and thus on sediment rooting through catchments. In this study we compare grain size distributions of hillslope and channel sediments collected in four headwater catchments located in the Chilean Coastal Cordillera covering a strong bio-climatic gradient. 76 volumetric bulk samples were taken with grain sizes ranging from clay (d\,=\,0.3\,{$\mu$}m) to boulders (d\,{$>$}\,300\,mm). Results show that the production of fine material is strongly dependent on bio-chemical weathering intensity and hence humidity. The coarse fraction in hillslope material and channel sediments increases from arid to sub-humid conditions, presumably reflecting a higher intensity of mass wasting processes. Channels show varying degrees of armouring reflecting nonselective and thus transport-limited conditions under arid climate that are contrasted by relatively well sorted and armoured channel sediments in the humid and vegetated catchments, indicating size selective and supply-limited transport conditions. Channel grain sizes generally show high similarity to hillslope grain sizes of the same catchment, revealing the strong dependency of channel sediments on hillslope supply, at least in headwater catchments, transferring a bio-climatic control from the hillslopes to the channel system.},

  abstract = {Phenological changes have been observed globally for marine, freshwater and terrestrial species, and are an important element of the global biological `fingerprint' of climate change. Differences in rates of change could desynchronize seasonal species interactions within a food web, threatening ecosystem functioning. Quantification of this risk is hampered by the rarity of long-term data for multiple interacting species from the same ecosystem and by the diversity of possible phenological metrics, which vary in their ecological relevance to food web interactions. We compare phenological change for phytoplankton (chlorophyll a), zooplankton (Daphnia) and fish (perch, Perca fluviatilis) in two basins of Windermere over 40 years and determine whether change has differed among trophic levels, while explicitly accounting for among-metric differences in rates of change. Though rates of change differed markedly among the nine metrics used, seasonal events shifted earlier for all metrics and trophic levels: zooplankton advanced most, and fish least, rapidly. Evidence of altered synchrony was found in both lake basins, when combining information from all phenological metrics. However, comparisons based on single metrics did not consistently detect this signal. A multimetric approach showed that across trophic levels, earlier phenological events have been associated with increasing water temperature. However, for phytoplankton and zooplankton, phenological change was also associated with changes in resource availability. Lower silicate, and higher phosphorus, concentrations were associated with earlier phytoplankton growth, and earlier phytoplankton growth was associated with earlier zooplankton growth. The developing trophic mismatch detected between the dominant fish species in Windermere and important zooplankton food resources may ultimately affect fish survival and portend significant impacts upon ecosystem functioning. We advocate that future studies on phenological synchrony combine data from multiple phenological metrics, to increase confidence in assessments of change and likely ecological consequences.},

  abstract = {Recognition of the escalating hydrological alteration of rivers on a global scale and resultant environmental degradation, has led to the establishment of the science of environmental flow assessment whereby the quantity and quality of water required for ecosystem conservation and resource protection are determined. A global review of the present status of environmental flow methodologies revealed the existence of some 207 individual methodologies, recorded for 44 countries within six world regions. These could be differentiated into hydrological, hydraulic rating, habitat simulation and holistic methodologies, with a further two categories representing combination-type and other approaches. Although historically, the United States has been at the forefront of the development and application of methodologies for prescribing environmental flows, using 37\% of the global pool of techniques, parallel initiatives in other parts of the world have increasingly provided the impetus for significant advances in the field. Application of methodologies is typically at two or more levels. (1) Reconnaissance-level initiatives relying on hydrological methodologies are the largest group (30\% of the global total), applied in all world regions. Commonly, a modified Tennant method or arbitrary low flow indices is adopted, but efforts to enhance the ecological relevance and transferability of techniques across different regions and river types are underway. (2) At more comprehensive scales of assessment, two avenues of application of methodologies exist. In developed countries of the northern hemisphere, particularly, the instream flow incremental methodology (IFIM) or other similarly structured approaches are used. As a group, these methodologies are the second most widely applied worldwide, with emphasis on complex, hydrodynamic habitat modelling. The establishment of holistic methodologies as 8\% of the global total within a decade, marks an alternative route by which environmental flow assessment has advanced. Such methodologies, several of which are scenario-based, address the flow requirements of the entire riverine ecosystem, based on explicit links between changes in flow regime and the consequences for the biophysical environment. Recent advancements include the consideration of ecosystem-dependent livelihoods and a benchmarking process suitable for evaluating alternative water resource developments at basin scale, in relatively poorly known systems. Although centred in Australia and South Africa, holistic methodologies have stimulated considerable interest elsewhere. They may be especially appropriate in developing world regions, where environmental flow research is in its infancy and water allocations for ecosystems must, for the time being at least, be based on scant data, best professional judgement and risk assessment.

In these organisms the metabolism of methane starts with its oxidation with O2 to methanol, a reaction catalyzed by a monooxygenase and therefore restricted to the aerobic world. Methane has recently been shown to also fuel the growth of anaerobic microorganisms. The oxidation of methane with sulfate and with nitrate have been reported, but the mechanisms of anaerobic methane oxidation still remains elusive. Sulfate-dependent methane oxidation is catalyzed by methanotrophic archaea, which are related to the Methanosarcinales and which grow in close association with sulfate-reducing delta-proteobacteria. There is evidence that anaerobic methane oxidation with sulfate proceeds at least in part via reversed methanogenesis involving the nickel enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase for methane activation, which under standard conditions is an endergonic reaction, and thus inherently slow. Methane oxidation coupled to denitrification is mediated by bacteria belonging to a novel phylum and does not involve methyl-coenzyme M reductase. The first step in methane oxidation is most likely the exergonic formation of 2-methylsuccinate from fumarate and methane catalyzed by a glycine-radical enzyme.},

BC supports spawning Oncorhynchus gorbuscha (pink salmon) and SC used to support spawning Oncorhynchus kisutch (coho salmon). At each location, samples were taken to determine DO levels, air temperatures, water temperatures and a qualitative study of plant life at an upper and lower site at each creek was observed. The three null hypotheses are: DO levels will be the same at both BC and SC, water temperatures will be the same at both BC and SC, and air temperatures will be the same at both BC and SC. The alternative hypothesis is that DO levels and temperatures will be different at BC and SC. The data for DO levels, air temperatures and water emperatures was analyzed using a Welch's t-test in R Software. After this analysis, the three null hypotheses\&nbsp; were rejected and the alternative hypothesis was accepted. DO levels were significantly higher at SC compared to BC and water and air temperatures at SC were significantly higher compared to BC. The relationship between temperature and DO level is illustrated by Henry's Law which indicates that colder temperatures equate to higher DO levels in water. Thus, our results illustrate an unexpected difference between expected DO levels and temperatures where pink salmon spawn in BC. At SC, DO levels were within a range to sustain coho salmon life, but the water temperature was outside of this range and may explain why spawning does not occur in SC.},

Freshwater macroinvertebrates were additionally collected and specific community metrics were derived. To identify possible pre- and post- impact benthic community differences, independent sample t-tests were applied, while Boosted Regression Tree models were developed to quantify the response of macroinvertebrates to flow alteration. Macroinvertebrate abundance, taxonomic richness, EPT richness and diversity decreased significantly by 90\%, 60\%, 50\% and 25\% respectively between the pre- and post- impact microhabitats. The relative abundance of macroinvertebrate predators and passive filter feeders increased after the event, mainly in specific substrate types (boulders and large stones), which served as flow refugia, maintaining less degraded (compared to finer substrates), still heavily impacted, benthic communities. According to the hydroecological analysis, the high flow event exerted the strongest impact on all macroinvertebrate metrics. Optimal (suitable) ranges of the hydraulic-habitat variables for benthic macroinvertebrates were identified (optimal flow velocity from 0.3m/s to 0.7m/s, optimal water depth at 0.2m), while boulders and large stones were the most suitable substrate types. The aforementioned data provide valuable information for the provisioning of biologically-derived environmental flows and an essential input of hydrodynamic habitat models to facilitate the selection of the optimal environmental flow scenario towards ensuring the integrity of aquatic ecosystems downstream of anthropogenic activities provoking hydrological alteration.},

In this study, we applied a two-dimensional hydrodynamic habitat model using benthic macroinvertebrates as the target aquatic community and carried out an environmental flow (eflow) assessment downstream of the Marathon Reservoir (Attica, Central Greece). Hydrology-based eflow scenarios were additionally developed over an 11-year period, and the lowest acceptable ecosystem-based eflow was compared with the hydrology-based eflow predictions. We found that the hydrological methods tend to underestimate the eflows required to ensure functional aquatic ecosystems. The results showed that (a) the different hydrological methods developed highly variable eflow scenarios, ranging from 0.0006 to 0.18 m3/s, (b) the ecosystem-based eflow was up to 183\% higher than the hydrology-based ones and 26\% to 465\% higher than those defined by the national legislation, and (c) the probability of agreement between hydrological and ecological predictions was 12.5\%, as only one out of the eight hydrology-based scenarios coincided with the ecosystem-based eflows. We conclude that hydrological methods should be used with caution in the absence of ecological information. Their use as stand-alone tools seems problematic and bears a high risk of producing inappropriate eflow scenarios. Integrative frameworks combining hydrological{\textendash}ecological methods could be useful to provide information on what is ecologically acceptable and hydrologically socially feasible, but because the two methods comprise structurally different, noninteracting concepts, they are inherently insufficient to increase the confidence of predicting and selecting eflows.},

In this study, we assembled a benthic-macroinvertebrate microhabitat-preference dataset and used it to evaluate the predictive accuracy of regression-based univariate Habitat Suitability Curves (HSC), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Random Forests (RF), fuzzy-logic-based models using the weighted average (FLWA), maximum membership (FLMM), mean of maximum (FLM) and centroid (FLC) defuzzification algorithms and fuzzy rule-based Bayesian inference (FRB). The results show that the BRT model was the most accurate, closely followed by RF, FRB, FLM and FLMM while the FLC and FLWA algorithms had the lowest performance. However, due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset and in contrast to the fuzzy rule-based algorithms, the HSC, BRT and RF models failed to accurately predict the habitat suitability in low-scored microhabitats. We conclude that, given balanced datasets, BRT and RF can be effectively used in habitat suitability modelling. For imbalanced datasets, a properly adjusted RF model can be applied but when the input dataset is large enough to provide sufficient data-driven IF{\textendash}THEN rules to train an FRB, FLMM or FLM algorithm, these models will produce the most accurate predictions.},

In this study, we utilized satellite-derived chlorophyll a concentrations for Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA in conjunction with data on water flow velocities and dissolved oxygen concentrations to identify potential restoration locations that would maximize the oyster reef-associated ecosystem service of water filtration. We integrated these novel factors associated with oyster water filtration ecosystem services within an existing, `Metapopulation Persistence' focused GIS-based, HSI model containing biophysical (e.g., salinity, oyster larval connectivity) and logistical (e.g., distance to nearest restoration material stockpile site) factors to identify suitable locations for oyster restoration that maximize long-term persistence of restored oyster populations and water filtration ecosystem service provision. Furthermore, we compared the `Water Filtration' optimized HSI with the HSI optimized for `Metapopulation Persistence,' as well as a hybrid model that optimized for both water filtration and metapopulation persistence. Optimal restoration locations (i.e., locations corresponding to the top 1\% of suitability scores) were identified that were consistent among the three HSI scenarios (i.e., ``win-win'' locations), as well as optimal locations unique to a given HSI scenario (i.e., ``tradeoff'' locations). The modeling framework utilized in this study can provide guidance to restoration practitioners to maximize the cost-efficiency and ecosystem services value of habitat restoration efforts. Furthermore, the functional relationships between oyster water filtration and chlorophyll a concentrations, water flow velocities, and dissolved oxygen applied in this study can guide field- and lab-testing of hypotheses related to optimal conditions for oyster reef restoration to maximize water quality enhancement benefits.},

Effective feature representation is critical in the development of high-performance scene categorization techniques because sensor data processing is tough. Remote sensing as well as deep learning abilities have made it easier to extract spatiotemporal information for classification. Furthermore, other scientific disciplines, together with remote sensing, have made significant advances in image categorization by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and transfer learning is being combined. Image categorization in this article was performed to enrich the accuracy of Scene classification using Transfer learning utilizing pre-trained Alex Net, and Visual Geometry Group (VGG) networks and compared with feature extraction methods. First, features were retrieved from the pre-trained network's second fully-connected layer and employed in SVM classification. Second, substituting the last layers of pre-trained networks with the notion of transfer learning was used to categorize new datasets. It is executed on the UCM Dataset as well as the SIRI-WHU Dataset. The proposed methodologies produced improved accuracy of 95\% for UCM, 93\% for SIRI-WHU Datasets.},

  abstract = {Biofilm growth may considerably influence the erodibility of river bed sediments and is, thus, an important morphological feature. The extent to which the sediment is stabilized depends on many environmental conditions and even though it is well accepted that these conditions are responsible for the variance of results obtained from field studies, little is known about their impact on biostabilization. In this article, the results from five long-term (4{\textendash}8 weeks) experiments are presented, investigating the impact of hydrodynamics and light intensity on biostabilization in different seasons. Biofilms are cultivated in a sophisticated setup of six identical straight flumes by circulating natural river water over glass beads with diameters between 0.1 and 0.2 mm. During the course of the experiments biofilm samples are eroded regularly to determine the critical shear stress and to learn more about the erosional behavior of biostabilized sediments. The results indicate a large variance of biostabilization between seasons with the highest values in spring and the lowest in late autumn. Presumably, this is explained by the differences in biofilm growth and composition resulting in mechanically diverse responses to the increased bed shear stress. Higher bed shear stress during cultivation delayed biofilm growth possibly due to reduced net attachment and growth of formerly advected microbes on the sediment surface. Unexpectedly, no substantial biostabilization effect is detected in experiments where biofilms are cultivated in darkness. Another focus in this article is the analysis of the mechanical behavior observed during erosion of the biofilms, that is shown to be an important aspect for the understanding of freshwater biostabilization caused by young growing biofilms.},

The role of water quality modeling in providing input to the decision-making process through understanding, dialogue, and consensus is discussed. The evolution of models is seen in three stages. During the first stage (1925 to about 1980), all sources (point, nonpoint, and sediment) were external to the model, but only point sources were directly linked to the originating input. During the second stage (about 1980 to 1990), sediment models were coupled to the water column and hydrodynamic' and watershed models were linked. A link was then established from watershed models to the input of the watershed. During the third stage (currently under way), airshed models are being incorporated with expansion to include other aspects of aquatic ecosystem. The Chesapeake Bay is used as an illustration. Issues of model credibility and confirmation are discussed; ultimately, the scientific and engineering community decides on the suitability of a modeling framework. The growth in model size over the history of modeling has been significant and parallels the increase in computing power. Future modeling challenges lie ahead in the areas of watershed models, airshed-watershed-estuarine-coastal ocean models, and whole ecosystem, living resources models. The success of water quality models will not necessarily be due to "bigness" and complexity but rather to increases in understanding, which can contribute to building consensus in water quality management decision-making.},

  abstract = {Although most plastic pollution originates on land, current research largely remains focused on aquatic ecosystems. Studies pioneering terrestrial microplastic research have adapted analytical methods from aquatic research without acknowledging the complex nature of soil. Meanwhile, novel methods have been developed and further refined. However, methodical inconsistencies still challenge a comprehensive understanding of microplastic occurrence and fate in and on soil. This review aims to disentangle the variety of state-of-the-art sample preparation techniques for heterogeneous solid matrices to identify and discuss best-practice methods for soil-focused microplastic analyses. We show that soil sampling, homogenization, and aggregate dispersion are often neglected or incompletely documented. Microplastic preconcentration is typically performed by separating inorganic soil constituents with high-density salt solutions. Not yet standardized but currently most used separation setups involve overflowing beakers to retrieve supernatant plastics, although closed-design separation funnels probably reduce the risk of contamination. Fenton reagent may be particularly useful to digest soil organic matter if suspected to interfere with subsequent microplastic quantification. A promising new approach is extraction of target polymers with organic solvents. However, insufficiently characterized soils still impede an informed decision on optimal sample preparation. Further research and method development thus requires thorough validation and quality control with well-characterized matrices to enable robust routine analyses for terrestrial microplastics.},

It fits a general parabolic equation of the form Y = B + (1 - B)(1 - N)p to the observations, where Y is the observed global solar radiation divided by clear sky radiation and N is the sky cover. The variables B (the point at which the parabola crosses the y axis) and P (a variable parameter less than 1.0) are selected to minimize the sum of the errors (Y - Ycalc)2, where Ycalc is the calculated value of Y. The equation Y = B + (1 - B)(1 - N)0.61 is selected as most representative, and the B values in this equation that minimize the sum of the errors squared for the individual stations are shown in Figure 1. The average absolute error of the 5306 data points is 1.18 MJ m-2, or 7\% of the average observed radiation. Because of the uncertainties of the observed global solar radiation and observed sky cover, the procedure should be used with caution, particularly for periods of less than 1 month.},

  abstract = {Stream drying, especially in the western United States, is becoming more common as the climate warms and precipitation patterns become less predictable; consequently, fisheries managers need to prioritize conservation efforts where water (and fish) will persist in the future. Yellow Creek in the upper Bear River watershed (Utah and Wyoming) contains one of the largest remaining populations of Northern Leatherside Chub Lepidomeda copei, an imperiled fish. Lower reaches are drying during summer months, partly due to water withdrawals, thus reducing Northern Leatherside Chub populations and relegating the remaining fish to isolated pools until the water returns. This study used an unmanned aerial vehicle to capture high-resolution and spatially explicit imagery over 19 km of Yellow Creek in a few weeks during late August when the water is the most limiting to the fish. Through imagery and subsequent GIS analysis, we identified 405 previously unknown potential refuge-pool habitats for Northern Leatherside Chub and determined their location, size, and spatial distribution, thereby helping managers prioritize stream reaches for native fish conservation and restoration. While the cost of unmanned aerial vehicle flights was estimated to be 2.5 times that of on-the-ground surveys in 2016, unmanned aerial vehicle technology continues to become more cost effective and, unlike traditional surveys, provides high-resolution and spatially referenced data.},

  abstract = {We propose an integrated, heuristic model of lotic biocomplexity across spatiotemporal scales from headwaters to large rivers. This riverine ecosystem synthesis (RES) provides a framework for understanding both broad, often discontinuous patterns along longitudinal and lateral dimensions of river networks and local ecological patterns across various temporal and smaller spatial scales. Rather than posing a completely new model, we arrange a conceptual marriage of eco-geomorphology (ecological aspects of fluvial geomorphology) with a terrestrial landscape model describing hierarchical patch dynamics. We modify five components of this terrestrial model for lotic ecosystems: (1) nested, discontinuous hierarchies of patch mosaics; (2) ecosystem dynamics as a composite of intra- and inter-patch dynamics; (3) linked patterns and processes; (4) dominance of non-equilibrial and stochastic processes; and (5) formation of a quasi-equilibrial, metastable state. Our conceptual model blends our perspectives on biocomplexity with aspects of aquatic models proposed from 1980{\textendash}2004. Contrasting with a common view of rivers as continuous, longitudinal gradients in physical conditions, the RES portrays rivers as downstream arrays of large hydrogeomorphic patches (e.g. constricted, braided and floodplain channel areas) formed by catchment geomorphology and climate. The longitudinal distribution of these patches, which are identifiable using standard geomorphic techniques, varies amongst rivers and is difficult to forecast above ecoregional scales. Some types of hydrogeomorphic patches may reoccur along this downstream passage. Unique ecological `functional process zones' are formed by individual types of hydrogeomorphic patches because of physiochemical habitat differences which affect ecosystem structure and function. The RES currently includes 14 tenets predicting how patterns of individual species distributions, community regulation, lotic ecosystem processes, and floodplain interactions will vary over spatiotemporal scales, especially as they relate to the functional process zones formed by hydrogeomorphic differences in the river network.

The results indicate that the sediment load and streamflow of LRB would significantly decrease, and the reduction of former is consistently higher than the that of latter in all scenarios and periods. Changes in streamflow and sediment load are mainly caused by temperature increase.

However, fast and accurate inference for processes of complex systems cannot easily be achieved in real-time with state-of-the-art methods under noisy real-world conditions with the requirement of a real-time response. The primary reason is that the inference of model parameters with traditional techniques based on optimization or sampling often suffers from computational and statistical challenges, resulting in a trade-off between accuracy and deployment time. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for inference of model parameters based on reinforcement learning. The proposed methodology is demonstrated and evaluated on two different physics-based models of turbofan engines. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms all other tested methods in terms of speed and robustness, with high inference accuracy.},

Analysing the change of the river pattern, a new discrimination line has been derived, which separates the meandering zone on the classic slope vs. discharge diagram into two subzones. The first subzone (lower slope values) corresponds to a range of true, self-organized meandering. The second subzone (higher slope values) corresponds to a range of `unorganized meandering'. This is a range where river sinuosity decreases although the channel slope increases. In the case of the Tisza River, this subzone equals to the wandering river pattern.},

  abstract = {1. One of the last remnants of a functional alluvial landscape on the Danube extends from Vienna to the Slovakian frontier. It is recognized as an ecosystem extremely worthy of protection and therefore has been designated as a National Park (`Alluvial Zone National Park'). 2. However, surface connectivity has been reduced and floodplain habits have been fragmented. At present, lateral exchange processes of matter are restricted to short-term flood pulses, while most of the year backwater processes are de-coupled from the river system. 3. A very high species diversity is recorded for this section, with a high proportion of endangered species in all groups, ranging from 16\% for riparian vascular plants to 100\% for amphibians and reptiles. High diversity is mainly a result of the remaining spatial array of water bodies of different age across the river-floodplain complex (between-channel diversity). 4. A successful conservation strategy for this floodplain area requires a management scheme based on a solid conceptual foundation of the key processes in river-floodplain systems. Re-establishing hydrological dynamics is recognized as the most vital step, because other processes are influenced by the flow regime and resulting connectivity. Therefore, a large-scale pilot project has been developed for a segment of the free-flowing section to restore gradually the hydrological connectivity between the river and its floodplain. 5. The side-arm system will be reconnected to the main channel by lowering parts of the riverside embankments. After implementation, the side-arm system will be integrated with the flow regime of the river for more than half of an average year (at present: {$<$}8 days per year). 6. A key challenge in the evaluation of the effects of restoration is the development and testing of an appropriate monitoring scheme, which has to include a wide range of physical, chemical, geomorphic, and ecological parameters. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

These channels are particularly important habitat for salmonids, many of which are currently at risk worldwide and which incubate their offspring within the hyporheic zone. Here we perform a set of laboratory experiments examining the effects of discharge and bed form amplitude on hyporheic exchange, with surface-subsurface mixing measured directly from the concentration decay of a conservative tracer (fluorescein) injected into the surface flow. Near-bed pressure measurements were also used to predict hyporheic exchange from a three-dimensional pumping transport model. Comparison of the predicted and observed hyporheic exchange shows good agreement, indicating that the major mechanism for exchange is bed form{\textendash}induced advection. However, the effect of bed forms is modulated by discharge and the degree of topographic submergence. We also tested the performance of the hydrostatic pressure as a proxy for the observed near-bed pressure in driving hyporheic exchange, which would facilitate field measurement and analysis of hyporheic flow in natural rivers. We found agreement with measured hyporheic exchange only for low bed form amplitudes and high flows.},

It discusses the basic knowledge and terminology of hydraulic modelling. The chapter focuses on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling and its application in ecohydraulics. It describes the fundamental equations of CFD. The methods for predicting flow properties are divided into four categories: three-dimensional (3D) hydraulic models, two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models, one-dimensional (1D) hydraulic models and non-numerical hydraulic modelling. The chapter introduces the fundamental topics and concepts of numerical modeling. It describes the features of and differences among hydraulic model approaches and the major elements needed to set up numerical models. The chapter presents four case studies where the underlying hydrodynamic processes drive certain ecological functions, such as the availability of habitats for certain fish or types of vegetation.},

  abstract = {Stream biophysical processes are commonly studied using multi-dimensional numerical modelling that quantifies flow hydraulics from which parameters such as habitat suitability, stream carrying capacity, and bed mobility are derived. These analyses would benefit from accurate high-resolution stream bathymetries spanning tens of kilometres of channel, especially in small streams or where navigation is difficult. Traditional ground-based survey methods are limited by survey time, dense vegetation and stream access, and are usually only feasible for short reaches. Conversely, airborne topobathymetric LiDAR surveys may overcome these limitations, although limited research is available on how errors in LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) might propagate through flow models. This study investigated the performance of LiDAR-derived topobathymetry in support of multi-dimensional flow modelling and ecohydraulics calculations in two gravel-bedded reaches (approximately 200 m long), one morphologically complex and one morphologically simple, and at the segment scale (32 km-long stream segment) along a 15 m-wide river in central Idaho, USA. We compared metre and sub-metre-resolution DEMs generated from RTK-GPS ground and Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR-B (EAARL-B) surveys and water depths, velocities, shear stresses, habitat suitability, and bed mobility modelled with two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models supported by LiDAR and ground-surveyed DEMs. Residual statistics, bias (B), and standard deviation (SD) of the residuals between depth and velocity predicted from the model supported by LiDAR and ground-survey topobathymetries were up to -0.04 (B) and 0.09 m (SD) for depth and -0.09 (B) and 0.20 m s-1 (SD) for velocity. The accuracy (B = 0.05 m), precision (SD = 0.09 m), and point density (1 point m-2) of the LiDAR topobathymetric survey (regardless of reach complexity) were sufficient to support 2D hydrodynamic modelling and derivative stream habitat and process analyses, because these statistics were comparable to those of model calibration with B = 0 m and SD = 0.04 m for water surface elevation and B = 0.05 m s-1 and SD = 0.22 m s-1 for velocity in our investigation. {\textcopyright} 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The idea that dryland fluvial environments are somehow distinctive or even unique compared to fluvial environments in wetter and/or cooler climatic settings has arisen in much of the literature, despite the fact that drylands are themselves inherently diverse, covering a wide range of local climatic, tectonic, structural, lithological, and phytogeographical settings. Focusing on rivers in warm drylands, this chapter outlines the main characteristics of dryland rivers, including flow and sediment transport conditions, channel forms and dynamics, channel and floodplain sedimentology, and equilibrium and nonequilibrium behavior. Although dryland rivers are commonly ascribed a set of restricted characteristics that have been derived mainly from studies in short, steep, tectonically active catchments, investigations in larger, lower-gradient, tectonically stable catchments have revealed much greater diversity in river character both within and between drylands, and have demonstrated overlap with river characteristics in other climatic settings. With this global perspective, I argue that many previous statements regarding the distinctiveness of dryland river characteristics either can no longer be sustained as generalizations, or, at the very least, the geographical and geomorphological contexts for those generalizations need to be clarified. One of the key priorities for future research will be to identify and explain the spatial extent and frequency of occurrence of river styles across different drylands. In particular, research into the controls of meandering, straight, and anabranching rivers characteristic of some moderate- to low-energy Southern Hemisphere drylands has not only contributed to greater appreciation of the global diversity of dryland rivers but is also leading to a better understanding of rivers in general. Technological and methodological developments (especially in geochronology) are enhancing understanding of dryland river process, form, and change, and this will continue to facilitate interdisciplinary work in diverse scientific and applied contexts.},

  abstract = {Methane is considered to be a significant greenhouse gas. Methane is produced in soils as the end product of the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. In the absence of oxygen, methane is very stable, but under aerobic conditions it is mineralized to carbon dioxide by methanotrophic bacteria. Soil methane emissions, primarily from natural wetlands, landfills and rice paddies, are estimated to represent about half of the annual global methane production. Oxidation of atmospheric methane by well-drained soils accounts for about 10\% of the global methane sink. Whether a soil is a net source or sink for methane depends on the relative rates of methanogenic and methanotrophic activity. A number of factors including pH, Eh, temperature and moisture content influence methane transforming bacterial populations and soil fluxes. Several techniques are available for measuring methane fluxes. Flux estimation is complicated by spatial and temporal variability. Soil management can impact methane transformations. For example, landfilling of organic matter can result in significant methane emissions, whereas some cultural practices such as nitrogen fertilization inhibit methane oxidation by agricultural soils.

  abstract = {Torrential processes are among the main actors responsible for sediment production and mobility in mountain catchments. For this reason, the understanding of preferential pathways for sediment routing has become a priority in hazard assessment and mitigation. In this context, the sediment Connectivity Index (IC) enables to analyse the existing linkage between sediment sources and the selected target (channel network or catchment outlet). The IC is a grid-based index that allows fast computation of sediment connectivity based on landscape information derived from a single Digital Terrain Model (DTM). The index computation is based on the log-ratio between an upslope and a downslope component, including information about drainage area, slope, terrain roughness, and distance to the analysis target (e.g. outlet). The output is a map that highlights the degree of structural connectivity of sediment pathways over analysed catchments. Until now, these maps are however rarely used to help defining debris-flow hazard maps, notably due to a lack of guidelines to interpret the IC spatial distribution. This paper proposes an exploitation procedure along profiles to extract more information from the analysis of mapped IC values. The methodology relies on the analysis of the IC and its component variables along the main channel profile, integrated with information about sediment budgeting derived from Difference of DEMs (DoD). The study of connectivity was applied in the unmanaged sub-catchment (without torrent control works) of the Rio Soial (Autonomous Province of Trento {\textendash} NE Italy) to understanding the geomorphic evolution of the area after five debris flows (in ten years) and the related changes of sediment connectivity. Using a recent DTM as validation, we demonstrated how an IC analysis over the older DTM can help predicting geomorphic changes and associated hazards. The results show an IC aptitude to capture geomorphic trajectories, anticipate debris flow deposits in a specific channel location, and depict preferential routing pathways..},

The targets set by the United Nations under Sustainable Development Goal 6 in relation to freshwater ecosystems also make accurate surface water monitoring increasingly vital. However, the last decades have seen a steady decline in in situ hydrological monitoring and the availability of the growing volume of environmental data from free and open satellite systems is increasingly being recognized as an essential tool for largescale monitoring of water resources. The scientific literature holds many promising studies on satellite-based surface-water mapping, but a systematic evaluation has been lacking. Therefore, a round robin exercise was organized to conduct an intercomparison of 14 different satellite-based approaches for monitoring inland surface dynamics with Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 imagery. The objective was to achieve a better understanding of the pros and cons of different sensors and models for surface water detection and monitoring. Results indicate that, while using a single sensor approach (applying either optical or radar satellite data) can provide comprehensive results for very specific localities, a dual sensor approach (combining data from both optical and radar satellites) is the most effective way to undertake largescale national and regional surface water mapping across bioclimatic gradients.},

  abstract = {Restoration of an alluvial wet-meadow system was conducted in the late 1990s to reestablish hydraulic interactions between the river, floodplain, and groundwater to support aquatic{\textendash}riparian ecosystem function. A single-discharge approach sized the bankfull channel dimensions to the effective discharge (Qe) and three degrees of channel widening relative to the Qe design were explored to identify which design attained dynamic equilibrium in the shortest time. The three experimental channel designs were implemented with bankfull widths of 96\%, 157\%, and 191\%, respectively, of the Qe geometry. Response trajectories were documented for channel dimensions, sediment mobility, channel morphology, floodplain connectivity, and riparian vegetation for the three channel designs, and the efficacy of a single-discharge approach for restoration was examined. Analysis of 20~years of monitoring data and hydraulic modeling revealed that each design responded differently to the imposed initial channel conditions and evolved at substantially different rates. The design with bankfull dimensions most closely approximating Qe reached dynamic equilibrium within four years of restoration, whereas the moderately over-widened channel (57\% larger) exhibited slower responses toward dynamic equilibrium for some metrics and did not fully attain the Qe design dimensions within the monitoring period. The extremely-over-widened channel (91\% larger) mainly induced slow rates of bed deposition that are projected to take nearly 300~years for the bankfull dimensions to narrow to the Qe width. All reaches had low bed mobility (bankfull Shields stress~{$<~$}0.03) 14~years after restoration, demonstrating the challenge of reducing the drivers of channel widening, while maintaining sufficient competence for bedload transport and a sustained supply of coarse bed material for salmonid habitat. Restoration that sizes the channel to Qe can provide rapid dynamic equilibrium, but is a first-order simplification of 1) channel dynamics and 2) the range of flows needed for restoring physical and biological processes in wet-meadow systems.},

  abstract = {When minimizing a nonlinear least-squares function, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm can suffer from a slow convergence, particularly when it must navigate a narrow canyon en route to a best fit. On the other hand, when the least-squares function is very flat, the algorithm may easily become lost in parameter space. We introduce several improvements to the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in order to improve both its convergence speed and robustness to initial parameter guesses. We update the usual step to include a geodesic acceleration correction term, explore a systematic way of accepting uphill steps that may increase the residual sum of squares due to Umrigar and Nightingale, and employ the Broyden method to update the Jacobian matrix. We test these changes by comparing their performance on a number of test problems with standard implementations of the algorithm. We suggest that these two particular challenges, slow convergence and robustness to initial guesses, are complimentary problems. Schemes that improve convergence speed often make the algorithm less robust to the initial guess, and vice versa. We provide an open source implementation of our improvements that allow the user to adjust the algorithm parameters to suit particular needs.},

  abstract = {Exchange of water and solutes across the stream-sediment interface is an important control for biogeochemical transformations in the hyporheic zone (HZ). In this paper, we investigate the interplay between turbulent stream flow and HZ flow in pool-riffle streams under various ambient groundwater flow conditions. Streambed pressures, derived from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, are assigned at the top of the groundwater model, and fluxes at the bottom of the groundwater model domain represent losing and gaining conditions. Simulations for different Reynolds numbers (Re) and pool-riffle morphologies are performed. Results show increasing hyporheic exchange flows (m3/d) for larger Re and a concurrent decrease in residence time (RT). Losing and gaining conditions were found to significantly affect the hyporheic flow field and diminish its spatial extent as well as rates of hyporheic exchange flow. The fraction of stream water circulating through the hyporheic zone is in the range of 1 {\texttimes} 10-5 to 1 {\texttimes} 10-6 per meter stream length, decreasing with increasing discharge. Complex distributions of pressure across the streambed cause significant lateral hyporheic flow components with a mean lateral travel distance of 20\% of the longitudinal flow paths length. We found that the relationship between pool-riffle height and hyporheic exchange flow is characterized by a threshold in pool-riffle amplitude, beyond which hyporheic exchange flow becomes independent of riffle height. Hyporheic residence time distributions (RTD) are log-normally distributed with medians ranging between 0.7 and 19 h.},

  abstract = {As microplastic studies grow, environmental concerns of all kinds of fibers are currently investigated. However, there is a gap in data regarding the impacts of digestion protocols on fibers integrity. This work focuses on the impact of five commonly used digestion protocols on the seven most produced fibers in traditional textile: three synthetics (polyamide 6.6 (PA 6.6), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyacrylonitrile (acrylic)), one artificial (viscose), two vegetal natural (cotton and flax) and one animal natural (wool). The protocols to be tested were selected based on the literature: 10\% KOH at 40 {\textdegree}C for 24 h; 10\% KOH at 60 {\textdegree}C for 24 h; diluted NaClO at room temperature ({\textasciitilde}20 {\textdegree}C) for 15 h; 30\% H2O2 at 40 {\textdegree}C for 48 h; Fenton's reagent with 30\% H2O2 for 2 h at room temperature ({\textasciitilde}20 {\textdegree}C). The fibers were characterized before and after digestion. The effects of those protocols on fibers integrity have been assessed using several of their performance parameters. High degradations were observed for PET with 10\% KOH 60 {\textdegree}C whereas almost no impact was observed at 40 {\textdegree}C. H2O2 digestion affects mechanical properties of different fibers, particularly PA 6.6. Both protocols should be avoided for synthetic fibers analyses. NaClO digestion mainly affected flax and viscose. Diluted NaClO at room temperature for 15 h, 10\% KOH at 40 {\textdegree}C for 24 h and Fenton's reagent are more appropriate to maintain fibers integrity.},

One very simple interpretation of validation is to quantify our belief in the predictive capability of a computational code through comparison with a set of experimental data. Uncertainty in both the data and the code are important and must be mathematically understood to correctly perform both calibration and validation. Sensitivity analysis, being an important methodology in uncertainty analysis, is thus important to both calibration and validation. In this paper, we intend to clarify the language just used and express some opinions on the associated issues. We will endeavor to identify some technical challenges that must be resolved for successful validation of a predictive modeling capability. One of these challenges is a formal description of a ``model discrepancy'' term. Another challenge revolves around the general adaptation of abstract learning theory as a formalism that potentially encompasses both calibration and validation in the face of model uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Dissolution trapping plays a significant role in CO2 geological storage. When CO2 dissolves in aquifer brines, the aqueous solution is heavier than the underlying resident brine. This results in convective instability in the form of CO2-rich fingers, which accelerates dissolution. It was recently shown that background flow affects CO2 dissolution by suppressing the development of convective fingers. However, there was a discrepancy between computational results and measurements, with the computational results demonstrating a decrease in the dissolution rate and the laboratory measurements showing no significant effect. Here, we attempted to understand this difference by exploring the relations between the transport mechanisms that facilitate convective mixing. We investigated the role of background flow by using numerical simulations that were validated by laboratory measurements and analytical solutions. Simulations were generated for the same porous medium and fluid pair used in the experiments, keeping the Rayleigh number constant, while changing the background velocity and the Peclet number. Studying the flux components revealed three distinct regimes characterized by the Peclet to Rayleigh ratio Pe/Ra. When Pe/Ra {$<$} 0.77, natural convection dominated, and dissolution remained approximately constant. When the background flow was large (Pe/Ra {$>$} 2), dissolution was controlled by pure forced convection and increased with Pe/Ra. In the intermediate range (0.77 {$<$} Pe/Ra {$<$} 2), both natural convection and forced convection were important.},

The methodology is based on a pressure-correction procedure within the frame of unstructured grids. Speci{\"y}ed pressures are imposed at the outlets of the two branches. The area ratio of the branch is allowed to vary in the range of 2{\textendash}3. Separation of the ow in the bifurcating region is inevitable. With equal outlet pressures, symmetrical ow patterns prevail except for the Y type branch under the conditions of high Reynolds numbers and large area ratios. This implies that the Y-branch ow is more sensitive to small disturbances. It is shown that with a slightly higher pressure imposed on one of the two branches the structure of the recirculating ow for the Y type is greatly a ected and the ow rate is reduced dramatically in the high-pressure branch channel. In contrast, the in uence on the Tee type branch is much lower since the ow behaves like a jet impinging on a con{\"y}ned duct. Copyright ? 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The long-term goal is thus to develop a sensor system, which includes spatial gradients of the flow field along a fish-shaped sensor body. Interpreting the biological relevance of a collection of point velocity measurements is complicated by the fact that fish and other aquatic vertebrates experience the flow field through highly dynamic fluid-body interactions. To collect body-centric flow data, a bioinspired fish-shaped probe is equipped with a lateral line pressure sensing array, which can be applied both in the laboratory and in the field. Our objective is to introduce a new type of measurement device for body-centric data and compare its output to estimates of conventional point-based technologies. We first provide the calibration workflow for laboratory investigations. We then provide a review of two velocity estimation workflows, independent of calibration. Such workflows are required as existing field investigations consist of measurements in environments where calibration is not feasible. The mean difference for uncalibrated LLP velocity estimates from 0 to 50 cm/s under in a closed flow tunnel and open channel flume was within 4 cm/s when compared to conventional measurement techniques. Finally, spatial flow maps in a scale vertical slot fishway are compared for the LLP, direct measurements, and 3D numerical models where it was found that the LLP provided a slight overestimation of the current velocity in the jet and underestimated the velocity in the recirculation zone.},

In an experiment designed to emphasize the minimization of energy expenditure through controlled predation and drift, we investigated whether juvenile coho, under winter conditions, discriminated between microhabitats based primarily on flow strength, depth, distance to wood, or based on temporal or spatial variability of the flow field, with the hypothesis that turbulence would be a strong factor in habitat selection. We conducted physical experiments in a 1:1 scale model of a large wood jam at the Oregon Hatchery Research Center in Alsea, Oregon. We conducted high resolution (0.1~m) mapping of the flow field using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter array and underwater videogrammetry of fish locations. Results indicated that discrimination of microhabitats by juvenile coho salmon in cold, low flows emphasized depth and distance to wood over any hydraulic measures of the flow field. Correlations between hydraulic parameters and distance to wood limited our ability to distinguish the importance of turbulence measures relative to velocities, but highlighted the positive relationships between velocity and turbulence measures and the negative relationships between hydraulics and distance from the roughness elements. Findings suggest areas of further study including potential thresholds of temperature and flow intensity on the importance of turbulence in habitat selection.},

  abstract = {Summary This paper presents a comprehensive review of sediment transport in ice-affected rivers by documenting a range of unique ice and sediment transport processes. In cold regions during winter, high sediment transport rates can occur under specific ice conditions, even if the channel discharge is low. River ice directly displaces and carries sediment, and some ice processes can move boulder-sized sediment, contributing to the sculpting of river channels in ways water alone could not. Special attention is directed to the ice breakup period, during which most dynamic ice processes take place and when sediment supply to river channels is maximized. Also discussed are the time and space scales over which ice processes affect sediment transport. Moreover, a global framework that describes the interconnectivity of climate, river discharge, channel morphology, in-stream hydraulics, and sediment transport response is proposed. Within this framework, ice processes are given a central function, as they influence and are affected by sediment transport, hydrological conditions, and channel morphology. A segment of this work reviews and explores the interconnectivity between river ice processes and river discharge as well as between river ice processes and channel morphology. The proposed framework represents a practical tool for a wide range of cold region river scientists and engineers, particularly in light of climate change.},

Formal definitions currently in use classify channels as bedrock when alluvial cover is discontinuous or thin. This is equated with a physical property of the flow. Using up-to-date erosion laws and descriptions of channel dynamics, we show that existing definitions are difficult to apply and may lead to conflicting classifications. We propose the definition: A bedrock channel cannot substantially widen, lower or shift its bed without eroding bedrock. Applied to channels in Taiwan, this leads to a different classification than previous definitions. By analysing at-a-station hydraulic geometry of these channels, we show that the classification exposes different controls of sediment effects on dynamics of channels classified as alluvial and bedrock.},

  abstract = {The partitioning of the total sediment load of a river into suspended load and bedload is an important problem in fluvial geomorphology, sedimentation engineering and sedimentology. Bedload transport rates are notoriously hard to measure and, at many sites, only suspended load data are available. Often the bedload fraction is estimated with `rule of thumb' methods such as Maddock's Table, which are inadequately field-tested. Here, the partitioning of sediment load for the Pitzbach is discussed, an Austrian mountain stream for which high temporal resolution data on both bedload and suspended load are available. The available data show large scatter on all scales. The fraction of the total load transported in suspension may vary between zero and one at the Pitzbach, while its average decreases with rising discharge (i.e. bedload transport is more important during floods). Existing data on short-term and long-term partitioning is reviewed and an empirical equation to estimate bedload transport rates from measured suspended load transport rates is suggested. The partitioning averaged over a flood can vary strongly from event to event. Similar variations may occur in the year-to-year averages. Using published simultaneous short-term field measurements of bedload and suspended load transport rates, Maddock's Table is reviewed and updated. Long-term average partitioning could be a function of the catchment geology, the fraction of the catchment covered by glaciers and the extent of forest, but the available data are insufficient to draw final conclusions. At a given drainage area, scatter is large, but the data show a minimal fraction of sediment transported in suspended load, which increases with increasing drainage area and with decreasing rock strength for gravel-bed rivers, whereby in large catchments the bedload fraction is insignificant at ca 1\%. For sand-bed rivers, the bedload fraction may be substantial (30\% to 50\%) even for large catchments. However, available data are scarce and of varying quality. Longterm partitioning varies widely among catchments and the available data are currently not sufficient to discriminate control parameters effectively.},

We use observation data from 193 locations in the Elbe River basin as well as spatially distributed erosion rates and sediment delivery simulated in the WaTEM/SEDEM to identify current erosion hotspots and to assess the impact of climate change on future erosion and sediment delivery. We further quantified the uncertainty of the modelling approach by using an ensemble of 21 combinations of global and regional climate models, different emission scenarios and stochastic erosion modelling. Erosion rates are highest on hilly arable land in the central part of the basin as well as in the northeast of Bohemia. Despite considerable differences between climate models and emission scenarios and considerable uncertainties of the erosion model, a future increase in soil erosion and sediment delivery is highly likely. Using the median of climate models and behavioral erosion models, this increase can be up to 14\% higher in the far future (2071{\textendash}2100) than in the reference period (1971{\textendash}2000) using RCP 8.5. The increase is highest in the Czech part of the basin.},

  abstract = {The braided Jamuna River frequently changes its courses. Sometimes the secondary channel in a braided river acts as a single thread meandering channel. In the present study an attempt has been made to investigate the flow patterns and to estimate the rate of bank erosion in a bend along the Jamuna River. The three dimensional (3D) flow velocities were measured using Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP). It is found that the near bank velocity is amplified by 1.1 to 1.3 times as compared with the section averaged velocity. A dominant secondary current is found in the upstream bend. The evolution as well as decay of the secondary current is not as clear as it is found in the laboratory experiments. It is revealed from the analysis of the flow process that the causes of higher rate of erosion at the study bend are the oblique flow near bankline, six times amplified shear velocity than critical shear velocity near bankline and the secondary current which acts as a sediment transporting agent from the outer bank towards the inner bank or the sand bar. Based on the flow processes, a simplified erosion prediction model is developed and applied to estimate the rate of erosion at a selected bend. Finally the predicted results have been compared with the observed data at the bend and all the available data at other bends along the Jamuna River.},

In the framework of a research project, the influence of the geometry of the reservoir on sediment transport and deposition is studied by experimental and theoretical approaches. As a reference case, a rectangular basin geometry was analyzed in detail. The experimental tests have been conducted in a rectangular shallow basin with inner dimensions of 6 m length and 4 m width. Different test procedures were examined. The flow and sediment conditions used during the tests grantee fully developed turbulent flow. Bed level changes, surface, and 3D flow velocities were measured. The results help to understand the mechanism of the flow and the sediment exchange process. In spite of the symmetric setup and only clear water entering; an asymmetric flow pattern developed. But after changing the condition by adding suspended sediment to water in the mixing tank the flow pattern changed and bed forms emerged. They indicate that the flow pattern can easily switch to different directions, depending on the boundary and initial conditions. Moreover, bed forms affect the flow structure. It confirms the important role of boundary conditions in sedimentation and flow field patterns. Furthermore, these first results allow assessing the time evolution of deposition patterns.},

  abstract = {An experimental field study was performed to investigate riverbed clogging processes and associated monitoring approaches near a dam-controlled riverbank filtration facility in Northern California. Motivated by previous studies at the site that indicated riverbed clogging plays an important role in the performance of the riverbank filtration system, we investigated the spatiotemporal variability and nature of the clogging. In particular, we investigated whether the clogging was due to abiotic or biotic mechanisms. A secondary aspect of the study was the testing of different methods to monitor riverbed clogging and related processes, such as seepage. Monitoring was conducted using both point-based approaches and spatially extensive geophysical approaches, including: grain-size analysis, temperature sensing, electrical resistivity tomography, seepage meters, microbial analysis, and cryocoring, along two transects. The point monitoring measurements suggested a substantial increase in riverbed biomass (2 orders of magnitude) after the dam was raised compared to the small increase ({$\sim$}2\%) in fine-grained sediment. These changes were concomitant with decreased seepage. The decreased seepage eventually led to the development of an unsaturated zone beneath the riverbed, which further decreased infiltration capacity. Comparison of our time-lapse grain-size and biomass datasets suggested that biotic processes played a greater role in clogging than did abiotic processes. Cryocoring and autonomous temperature loggers were most useful for locally monitoring clogging agents, while electrical resistivity data were useful for interpreting the spatial extent of a pumping-induced unsaturated zone that developed beneath the riverbed after riverbed clogging was initiated. The improved understanding of spatiotemporally variable riverbed clogging and monitoring approaches is expected to be useful for optimizing the riverbank filtration system operations.},

This work deals with the impact of various discretisations on simulation results of a recalculation of scale tests compared to a calibrated baseline scenario. Six different discretisation methods were applied for the approximation of the original grading curve using up to 12 fractions. For the simulation of each scenario a two-dimensional numerical software including a multi fraction-multi layer approach for bed load transport was applied. The results show that the significance of the choice of the discretisation method is clearly dependent on the prevalent system state.}

In such sediments, concentrations of colloidal carbohydrate [including the exopolymeric substances (EPS) produced by diatoms during motility] are closely correlated with the biomass (chlorophyll a) of epipelic diatoms. A model describing this relationship (log (conc. cell. carbo. + 1) = 1.40 + 1.02(log (chl. a cone. + 1)) was derived from published data. It tvas validated against published and unpublished data from 6 different estuaries, and accounted for 64.6\% of the variation in sediment colloidal carbohydrate concentrations. The model was valid for intertidal habitats with cohesive sediments where epipelic diatoms constituted {$>$}50\% of the microphytobenthic assemblage. In sites with noncohesive sediments, or where the microphytobenthic assemblage was dominated by other algal groups, the model was not applicable. The mean percentage of EPS in colloidal carbohydrate extracts varied between Ii and 37\% for axenic cultures of epipelic diatoms (with higher values obtained during stationary phase), and between 22.7\% and 24.3\% for natural sediments dominated by epipelic diatoms. Assuming an EPS percentage of 25\% in colloidal extracts yielded an EPS chi. a ratio of 2.62:1. Maximum rates of EPS production in diatom cultures occurred at the beginning of stationary phase (1.6-5.09 mu g EPS mu g(-1) chi a d(-1)), with Nitzschia sigma having a significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) higher rate of production than N. frustulum, Navicula perminuta and Surirella ovata. Similar rates of EPS production were measured in the field. The dynamics of EPS production and loss on mudflats is discussed, with reference to the model and these production rates.},

  abstract = {Given the limited resources available for managing erosion hazards and addressing water quality impairment along rivers, stakeholders engaged in water resource management would benefit from tools to identify those river reaches most prone to adjustment and which disproportionately load sediment to receiving waters. The extent and rate of vertical and lateral channel adjustments in response to natural and human disturbances vary considerably across space and time; and this complexity and nonlinearity introduce challenges for classification or modelling of river reaches using conventional statistical techniques. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a data-driven computational tool with advantages for clustering or classifying multivariate observations and for exploratory data analysis and visualization of complex, nonlinear systems. We applied a SOM to cluster multivariate stream geomorphic assessment data into reach-scale sediment process domains for 193 river reaches in glacially-conditioned catchments of northeastern US using field- and GIS-derived hydraulic and geomorphic parameters. The reaches comprised a range of channel types from confined to unconfined, steep- to shallow-gradient, mid-to-high order, and bedrock to alluvial channels. Fifteen variables were identified that meaningfully separated reaches into seven sediment regimes, following a two-stage application of the SOM. A coarse-tune SOM identified sediment regime classes at the supply-limited and transport-limited extremes of a continuum, including bedrock channels and confined, steep-gradient reaches as well as braided, depositional channels at alluvial fan or delta settings. A second-stage, fine-tune SOM nuanced differences in sediment production and transport for unconfined reaches with varying degrees of floodplain disconnection resulting from natural or human stressors. This classification framework is transferable to other hydroclimatic regions, with consideration of additional or alternate independent variables unique to those regions, and can provide valuable insights for river management to promote flood resiliency, restore water quality and improve instream and riparian habitats.},

  abstract = {High flow velocity near the free surface in rivers is due to the presence of shear stress near the bed and its absence on the free surface. This phenomenon results in unsteadiness of the vertical velocity profile. Moreover, secondary flows in river bends cause velocity variations, accordingly leading to changes in shear stress near the bed. The present study evaluates and analyzes the effect of streamlines variations, maximum velocity distribution, and secondary flow strength on bed shear stress distribution along a 180 degree sharp bend built in the Hydraulic Laboratory of Persian Gulf University. Results suggest of the occurrence of maximum secondary flow strength at the second half of the bend. The evaluation of bed shear stress distribution using the TKE, modified TKE, and Reynolds methods at turbulent boundary layer demonstrated that the maximum shear stress occurred from the entrance of the bend to the bend apex area near the inner wall. Moreover, comparison of the Reynolds shear stress method at distances of 5 and 15\% of the flow depth from the bed indicated that the maximum shear stress occurring at the lower layer moved from the 40 degree cross section to 60 degree cross section at the upper layer.},

To study the streamlines flowing a sharp bend, a 180{\textordmasculine} sharp bend was constructed at Persian Gulf University in Iran. Three dimensional flow components at different locations of the bend were measured using Vectrino velocim. In this paper, streamlines were drawn and investigated in different longitudinal profiles, cross sections, and plans. The results indicated that the secondary flow strength and size of the vortex formed at the distance of the beginning to the bend apex would increase. The core of central vortex moved away from the inner bank towards central line of the channel by 22\%, and to the water surface by 20\%. On the contrary, the size of the secondary vortex increased by 15\%. In addition, the average of the horizontal angle of the streamlines, vector and the locus of maximum velocity were determined at different levels in the present investigation.},

To this aim, SSIIM CFD software, one of the most powerful software applications in hydraulic engineering field, was employed. In this research, Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations and k{\textendash}{$\epsilon$} turbulent model were used for solving the flow field. The numerical results were verified using the experimental data. The comparison between the results of numerical simulation and experimental data collected by ADV velocimeter indicated a desirable agreement. The numerical results showed that the dimensions of the vortex at the downstream side of the spur dike reduced by increasing the angle of the spur dike. Moreover, the secondary flow strength value was the maximum for attractive and then repelling modes. Variation of the secondary flow strength for repelling, attractive, and vertical modes ranged from zero to 45, 35, and 25\% respectively. Although the range of the secondary flow values in vertical mode for both numerical and experimental models was identical and about 0{\textendash}25\%, less than a 5\% error between these two models demonstrated that the amount had been reasonable. By determination of flow separation zones, it was observed that, for all the three modes, the separation zone length increased by increasing the elevation. In addition, the lengths of the separation and reattachment zones were equal to 1.2{\textendash}2.7 and 1.57{\textendash}4.18 times the spur dike wing length.},

  abstract = {Side channel construction is a common intervention to increase both flood safety and the ecological value of the river. Three side channels of Gameren in the river Waal (The Netherlands) show amounts of large aggradation. We use bed level measurements and grain size samples to characterize the development of the side channels. We relate the bed level changes and the deposited sediment in the side channels to the results of hydrodynamic computations. Two of the three side channels filled mainly with suspended bed-material load. In one of these channels, the bed level increased enough that vegetation has grown and fine suspended load has settled. In the third side channel, the bed shear stresses are much smaller and, in addition to the suspended bed-material load, fine sediment settles. Based on the side channel system at Gameren, we identify two types of side channels: one type fills predominantly with suspended bed-material load from the main channel and a second type fills predominantly with fine suspended load. This gives an indication of the main mechanisms that lead to the aggradation in artificial side channel systems.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a study to determine the impact of gas production in dredging sludge on the storage capacity of artificial sludge depots. Gas is produced as a result of the decomposition of organic material present in dredging spoil. This process, in which methane and carbon dioxide are formed, may lead to expansion of sludge layers, partly or even completely counterbalancing consolidation. The study shows that, even with a very conservative estimation of the rate of gas production, accumulation of gas occurs as convective and diffusive transport proceed very slowly. Nucleation of gas bubbles occurs already at a limited oversaturation of pore water. During their growth, bubbles push aside the surrounding grain matrix. Resulting stresses may initiate cracks around bubbles. If these cracks join, they may form channels stretching out to the depot surface and along which gas may escape. However, channels are only stable to a limited depth below which bubble accumulation may continue. The gas content at which sufficient cracks and channels are formed to balance the rate of gas production with the rate of outflow strongly depends on the constitutive properties of the dredging sludge considered. In sludge with a high shear strength ({$>$}10 kPa), stable channels are created already at low deformations. However, a large expansion may occur in sludge with a low strength. The present study shows that accumulation of gas may continue until a bulk density less than that of water is attained. This is equivalent to a gas fraction of about 25{\textendash}37\%, depending on the initial water content of the sludge. Only then can gas escape as a result of instabilities in the sediment matrix. This should be well taken into account during the design and management of artificial depots. \# 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Via excretory processes, animals can supply nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) at rates comparable to major nutrient sources, and nutrient cycling by animals can support a substantial proportion of the nutrient demands of primary producers. In addition, animals may exert strong impacts on the species composition of primary producers via effects on nutrient supply rates and ratios. Animals can either recycle nutrients within a habitat, or translocate nutrients across habitats or ecosystems. Nutrient translocation by relatively large animals may be particularly important for stimulating new primary production and for increasing nutrient standing stocks in recipient habitats. Animals also have numerous indirect effects on nutrient fluxes via effects on their prey or by modification of the physical environment. Future studies must quantify how the importance of animal-mediated nutrient cycling varies among taxa and along environmental gradients such as ecosystem size and productivity.}

  abstract = {Many external effects of land use change are based on modifications of lateral flows of soil, water, air, fire or organisms. Lateral flows can be intercepted by filters and thus the severity and spatial range of external effects of land use change is under the influence of filter effects. Wherever lateral flows are involved, research results cannot be simply scaled on an area basis, and overall impact does not follow simple linear causal relationships. This complexity has consequences for relationships amongst the primary agents who initiate or exacerbate external effects, other stakeholders who are affected by them and policymakers who attempt to mitigate problems that reach sufficient visibility in society. In this paper we review how the relative importance of lateral flows and filter effects differs among a number of externalities, and the implications this has for research methods. If flows and filters are incompletely understood, policies may be based on fallacies. Whereas `fire-breaks' act as filters in the lateral flow of the high temperature pulse of a fire, smoke from land-based fires can be intercepted only by rainfall acting as a filter and the external impact of smoke is determined by the atmospheric conditions governing lateral flow and chemical transformations along the pathway. Causal relations in smoke and haze problems are relatively simple and may form a basis for designing policy interventions to reduce downwind damage. For biodiversity issues, landscape connectivity, the absence of filters restricting dispersal and movement of organisms, is increasingly recognised as an influence on the dynamics of species richness and its scaling relations. Biodiversity research methods can extend beyond the current descriptive stage into clarifying causal relations with a lateral flow perspective. The question whether connectivity is in fact desired, however, depends on stakeholder interests and situation. Forest functions in watershed protection, presumably leading to a continuous flow of clean water in the dry season through the subsoil instead of a rapid surface transfer, have been generally attributed to the trees rather than the forest, with its rough surface structure, swamps and infiltration sites. A new synthesis of site-specific hydrological knowledge and tree water balance studies may be needed to separate myth from reality, and avoid wasting public funds on tree planting under the heading of reforestation, without restoring the hydrological regime of a real forest. Soil movement can be intercepted at a range of scales and in as far as soil transport entails movement of soil fertility, filter zones can be very productive elements of a landscape. To achieve `integrated natural resource management' all external effects of land use will somehow have to be taken into account in farmer decision making about the use of natural resources on and off farm. Farmers' ecological knowledge may include concepts of lateral flows and should be further explored as an integral part of a new landscape ecological approach.},

  abstract = {Modeling the effect of biota on sediment dynamics is a difficult task. In this paper we re-analyze experimental results of Willows et al. (1998) on the effects of Macoma balthica on sediment erosion. A process-based framework is proposed, fully compatible with a physical description of erosion processes in case of no biogenic influences. The bed is represented by a fluff layer on top of a substrate. A characteristic feature of the framework is that the sediment is represented by a probability density distribution for the critical shear stress, allowing for Type I and Type II erosion. M. balthica increases the sediment mass in the fluff layer. This increase is determined by considering the action radius, the overlap of feeding areas, and the feeding rate per animal. The calibrated action radius and feeding rate were in the range as found in the literature. The distribution of sediment over the erodibility classes and the erosion rate parameter are hardly influenced at all. Due to overlapping feeding areas, the effect is non-linear with density of the animals. The model results are in close agreement with the measured results, suggesting that no further formulations of biological effects are needed to simulate the experiments of Willows et al. (1998). In nature, other effects like disrupting the biofilm by grazing can be of importance and should be included in a later stage. This study emphasizes the crucial role of sediment availability and the effect of biota on it. This aspect needs more attention in future experiments. The proposed model turned out to work well for the effects of M. balthica and offers opportunities to include other biogenic effects in a process-based way as well.},

  abstract = {Until the mid-1990s, a major limitation of using the Universal Soil Loss Equation and Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation erosion models at regional landscape scales was the difficulty in estimating LS factor (slope length and steepness) values suitable for use in geographic information systems applications. A series of ArcInfo{\texttrademark} Arc Macro Language scripts was subsequently created that enabled the production of either USLE- or RUSLE-based LS factor raster grids using a digital elevation model input data set. These scripts have functioned exceptionally well for both single- and multiple-watershed applications within targeted study areas. However, due to the nature and complexity of flowpath processing necessary to compute cumulative slope length, the scripts have not taken advantage of available computing resources to the extent possible. It was determined that the speed of the computer runs could be significantly increased without sacrificing accuracy in the final results by performing the majority of the elevation data processing in a two-dimensional array framework outside the ArcInfo environment. This paper describes the evolution of a major portion of the original RUSLE-based AML processing code to an array-based executable program using ANSI C++{\texttrademark} software. Examples of the relevant command-line arguments are provided and comparative results from several AML-vs.-executable time trials are also presented. In wide-ranging areas of the United States where it has been tested, the new RUSLE-based executable has produced LS-factor values that mimic those generated by the original AML as well as the RUSLE Handbook estimates. Anticipated uses of the executable program include water quality assessment, landscape ecology, land-use change detection studies, and decision support activities. This research has now given users the option of either running the executable file alone to process a single watershed reporting unit or running a supporting AML shell program that calls upon the executable file as necessary to perform automated processing for a user-specified number of watersheds.},

  abstract = {A new total sediment-load sampler is designed and tested in a flume. The new instrument consists of a bed-load sampler and a suspended-load sampler, both attached to a supporting frame. The suspended-load sampler consists of seven intake nozzles, which are connected to plastic hoses and operated by pumps. The bed-load sampler consists of a nozzle connected to a 150 {$\mu$}m or 240 {$\mu$}m-nylon bag. At the upper side of the bag, a 500 {$\mu$} nylon patch (0.1{\texttimes}0.15 m2) is present to reduce the blocking effect by fine particles. The bed load sampler is connected to a swing arm, which can move upward and downward to allow good contact between the sampler nozzle and the bed. The hydraulic coefficient of the bed-load sampler is found to be very close to unity for filling percentages of the bag up to 50\%. The sampling efficiency of the bed-load sampler is found to be somewhat larger than unity (1.2 to 1.4) at low transport rates (velocity smaller than 0.5 m/s).},

Two natural mud{\textendash}sand mixtures (percentage of sand {$\cong$} 35\% and 20\%) were used and artificial mixtures were made by adding fine sand to the natural mud samples; the percentage of sand was varied in the range of 30\%{\textendash}95\%.

Three types of erosion were identified (visually) during the flume experiments: particle/floc erosion, surface erosion by generation of local craters and grooves, and mass erosion (two types) by local bed collapse or by local breakout of lumps of bed material with clouds of escaping mud. Plots of the critical bed-shear stress for particle, surface, and mass erosion are given based on the data of the flume and Eromes tests. The critical bed shear for particle, surface, and mass erosion of natural mud{\textendash}sand beds is found to be primarily influenced by the percentage of fines ({$<$}63 {$\mu$}m), percentage of clay-silt ({$<$}8 {$\mu$}m), and the dry bulk density of the top layer of the bed.

Since river systems are shaped by disturbances from floods and droughts, typical riverine fish species should have evolved life history traits providing resilience against such disturbances. This study compiled and analyzed resilience traits of European lampreys and fish species to derive a novel sensitivity classification of species to mortality. We assembled life history traits like maximum length, migration type, mortality, fecundity, age at maturity, and generation time of 168 species and created a novel method to weigh and integrate all traits to generate a final sensitivity score from one (low sensitivity) to three (high sensitivity) for each species. Large-bodied, diadromous, rheophilic and lithophilic species such as sturgeons, sea trout, and Atlantic salmon usually appeared to have high sensitivity to additional adult fish mortality, whereas small-bodied, limnophilic and phytophilic species with fast generation cycles were of low sensitivity. The final scoring and classification of 168 European lampreys and fish species according to their sensitivity can be easily regionalized by selecting the most sensitive candidates according to the local species pool. This sensitivity classification has major implications for advancing impact assessment, allowing better targeting of species for conservation measures, benchmarking progress during rehabilitation and enhancing the objective evaluation of the success of restoration projects.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, 98\% of total electricity is currently produced by thermoelectric power and hydropower. Climate change is expected to directly impact electricity supply, in terms of both water availability for hydropower generation and cooling water usage for thermoelectric power. Improved understanding of how climate change may impact the availability and temperature of water resources is therefore of major importance. Here we use a multi-model ensemble to show the potential impacts of climate change on global hydropower and cooling water discharge potential. For the first time, combined projections of streamflow and water temperature were produced with three global hydrological models (GHMs) to account for uncertainties in the structure and parametrization of these GHMs in both water availability and water temperature. The GHMs were forced with bias-corrected output of five general circulation models (GCMs) for both the lowest and highest representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The ensemble projections of streamflow and water temperature were then used to quantify impacts on gross hydropower potential and cooling water discharge capacity of rivers worldwide. We show that global gross hydropower potential is expected to increase between +2.4\% (GCM-GHM ensemble mean for RCP 2.6) and +6.3\% (RCP 8.5) for the 2080s compared to 1971{\textendash}2000. The strongest increases in hydropower potential are expected for Central Africa, India, central Asia and the northern high-latitudes, with 18{\textendash}33\% of the world population living in these areas by the 2080s. Global mean cooling water discharge capacity is projected to decrease by 4.5-15\% (2080s). The largest reductions are found for the United States, Europe, eastern Asia, and southern parts of South America, Africa and Australia, where strong water temperature increases are projected combined with reductions in mean annual streamflow. These regions are expected to affect 11{\textendash}14\% (for RCP2.6 and the shared socio-economic pathway (SSP)1, SSP2, SSP4) and 41{\textendash}51\% (RCP8.5{\textendash}SSP3, SSP5) of the world population by the 2080s.},

Hypoxia is forecast to increase owing to the combined effects of the continued spread of coastal eutrophication and global warming. A broad comparative analysis across a range of contrasting marine benthic organisms showed that hypoxia thresholds vary greatly across marine benthic organisms and that the conventional definition of 2 mg O2/liter to designate waters as hypoxic is below the empirical sublethal and lethal O2 thresholds for half of the species tested. These results imply that the number and area of coastal ecosystems affected by hypoxia and the future extent of hypoxia impacts on marine life have been generally underestimated.}

By assuming that the bed shear stress direction along the bed was given by the VAM's near-bed velocity direction, it was possible to successfully reproduce the scour and deposition observed in a curved experimental flume and a meandering river reach. Although the VAM model is more general and does not require a secondary flow correction, as needed by conventional depth-averaged models, the results were not significantly better for the two cases analyzed.},

  abstract = {1. The assessment of links between ecology and physical habitat has become a major issue in river research and management. Key drivers include concerns about the conservation implications of human modifications (e.g. abstraction, climate change) and the explicit need to understand the ecological importance of hydromorphology as prescribed by the EU's Water Framework Directive. Efforts are focusing on the need to develop `eco-hydromorphology' at the interface between ecology, hydrology and fluvial geomorphology. Here, the scope of this emerging field is defined, some research and development issues are suggested, and a path for development is sketched out. 2. In the short term, major research priorities are to use existing literature or data better to identify patterns among organisms, ecological functions and river hydromorphological character. Another early priority is to identify model systems or organisms to act as research foci. In the medium term, the investigation of pattern{\textendash}processes linkages, spatial structuring, scaling relationships and system dynamics will advance mechanistic understanding. The effects of climate change, abstraction and river regulation, eco-hydromorphic resistance/resilience, and responses to environmental disturbances are likely to be management priorities. Large-scale catchment projects, in both rural and urban locations, should be promoted to concentrate collaborative efforts, to attract financial support and to raise the profile of eco-hydromorphology. 3. Eco-hydromorphological expertise is currently fragmented across the main contributory disciplines (ecology, hydrology, geomorphology, flood risk management, civil engineering), potentially restricting research and development. This is paradoxical given the shared vision across these fields for effective river management based on good science with social impact. A range of approaches is advocated to build sufficient, integrated capacity that will deliver science of real management value over the coming decades.

  abstract = {River forms and processes are, in many cases, conditioned by the consequences of anthropogenic modifications, widespread during the last two centuries, such as dams, embankments and gravel-mining. The effects of these human impacts have been typically investigated by fluvial geomorphologists based on a so-called expert-based approach whereby observed association or synchronicity between geomorphological changes and a given, preidentified impact, are interpreted as evidence of causation. This approach has important limitations when the effects of multiple human interventions interact along the same river corridor or overlap with legacy natural changes affecting the sediment - water balance. In such situations, the establishment of causal links between channel morphology and single impacts is not as straightforward as commonly assumed and our conclusions may be affected by `confirmation biases'. In this paper we highlight this risk through an assessment of human impacts on the Rh{\^o}ne river within a multi-driver context. The French Rh{\^o}ne is a perfect example of an Anthropocene river impacted by two main development phases during the 20th century: river training (1890s -1930s) and the construction of a series of dams (1950s -1990s). In this study we began by laying out four hypothetical and geomorphologically consistent scenarios for the geomorphological trajectory followed by the Rh{\^o}ne over the 20th century. Next, we tested these hypothetical scenarios against grain-size data collected in the field in a structured and hypothesis-oriented way. Using this hypothesis-driven and deductive attribution analysis we identified the relative impacts of the different development phases on the present-day grain-size distribution and in particular on armouring in the Rh{\^o}ne river, and proposed a hierarchy of dominant drivers of geomorphological change along the Rhone over the last century and a half. Based on the results of our study, we concluded that in the case of the Rh{\^o}ne, the effect of dams on armouring was negligible compared to a legacy of natural heritages and embankments.},

  abstract = {Regional environmental models often require detailed data on topography, land cover, soil, and climate. Remote sensing derived data form an increasingly important source of information for these models. Yet, it is often not easy to decide what the most feasible source of information is and how different input data affect model outcomes. This paper compares the quality and performance of remote sensing derived data for regional soil erosion and sediment yield modelling with the WATEM-SEDEM model in south-east Spain. An ASTER-derived digital elevation model (DEM) was compared with the DEM obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and land cover information from the CORINE database (CLC2000) was compared with classified ASTER satellite images. The SRTM DEM provided more accurate estimates of slope gradient and upslope drainage area than the ASTER DEM. The classified ASTER images provided a high accuracy (90\%) land cover map, and due to its higher resolution, it showed a more fragmented landscape than the CORINE land cover data. Notwithstanding the differences in quality and level of detail, CORINE and ASTER land cover data in combination with the SRTM DEM or ASTER DEM allowed accurate predictions of sediment yield at the catchment scale. Although the absolute values of erosion and sediment deposition were different, the qualitative spatial pattern of the major sources and sinks of sediments was comparable, irrespective of the DEM and land cover data used. However, due to its lower accuracy, the quantitative spatial pattern of predictions with the ASTER DEM will be worse than with the SRTM DEM. Therefore, the SRTM DEM in combination with ASTER-derived land cover data presumably provide most accurate spatially distributed estimates of soil erosion and sediment yield. Nevertheless, model calibration is required for each data set and resolution and validation of the spatial pattern of predictions is urgently needed.

  abstract = {Suspended sediment is a natural part of river systems and plays an essential role in structuring the landscape, creating ecological habitats and transporting nutrients. It is also a common management problem, where alterations to sediment quantity and quality negatively impact ecological communities, increase flood hazard and shorten the lifespan of infrastructure. To address these challenges and develop sustainable management strategies, we need a thorough understanding of sediment sources, pathways and transport dynamics and the drivers that underlie spatial and temporal variability in suspended sediment transport in rivers. However, research to date has not sufficiently addressed the temporal complexity of sediment transport processes, which is limiting our ability to disentangle the hydro-meteorological, catchment, channel and anthropogenic drivers of suspended sediment transport in rivers. This review critically evaluates previously published work on suspended sediment dynamics to demonstrate how the interpretation of sediment sources and pathways is influenced by the temporal scale and methodology of the study. To do this, the review (i) summarizes the main drivers of temporal variation in suspended sediment transport in rivers; (ii) critically reviews the common empirical approaches used to analyze and quantify sediment sources and loads, and their capacity to account for temporal variations; (iii) applies these findings to recent case studies to illustrate how method and timescale affect the interpretation of suspended sediment transport dynamics; and finally (iv) synthesizes the findings of the review into a set of guidelines for a multi-timescale approach to characterize the sediment regime of a river. By recognizing a priori that study design and temporal scale have an impact on the interpretation of suspended sediment dynamics and employing methods that address these issues, future research will be better able to identify the drivers of suspended sediment transport in rivers, improve sediment transport modelling, and propose effective, sustainable solutions to sediment management problems.},

  abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is increasingly depicted as an important element of the carbon dioxide mitigation portfolio. However, critics have warned that CCS might lead to ``reinforced fossil fuel lock-in'', by perpetuating a fossil fuel based energy provision system. Due to large-scale investments in CCS infrastructure, the fossil fuel based `regime' would be perpetuated to at least the end of this century. In this paper we investigate if and how CCS could help to avoid reinforcing fossil fuel lock-in. First we develop a set of criteria to estimate the degree of technological lock-in. We apply these criteria to assess the lock-in reinforcement effect of adding CCS to the fossil fuel socio-technical regime (FFR). In principle, carbon dioxide could be captured from any carbon dioxide point source. In the practice of present technological innovations, business strategies, and policy developments, CCS is most often coupled to coal power plants. However, there are many point sources of carbon dioxide that are not directly related to coal or even fossil fuels. For instance, many forms of bio-energy or biomass-based processes generate significant streams of carbon dioxide emissions. Capturing this carbon dioxide which was originally sequestered in biomass could lead to negative carbon dioxide emissions. We use the functional approach of technical innovations systems (TIS) to estimate in more detail the strengths of the ``niches'' CCS and Bio-Energy with CCS (BECCS). We also assess the orientation of the CCS niche towards the FFR and the risk of crowding out BECCS. Next we develop pathways for developing fossil energy carbon capture and storage, BECCS, and combinations of them, using transition pathways concepts. The outcome is that a large-scale BECCS development could be feasible under certain conditions, thus largely avoiding the risk of reinforced fossil fuel lock-in.},

  abstract = {In this paper we introduce a family of accelerated implicit-explicit (AIMEX) schemes for the solution of stiff systems of equations. Similar to conventional IMEX schemes, AIMEX schemes allow a problem to be split into its stiff and non-stiff constituent parts. These are then advanced in time using an implicit and explicit scheme, respectively. By design, AIMEX schemes have an arbitrarily large number of stages. This allows for optimization of the explicit part to improve its stability properties, increasing the allowable time step size. Importantly, only two implicit stages are required regardless of the total number of stages, meaning a larger global time step can be taken with significantly fewer implicit stages for a given simulation time. Numerical results demonstrate that AIMEX schemes achieve their designed order of accuracy for linear and non-linear problems involving mesh induced stiffness. Simulations of unsteady flow over an SD7003 airfoil using the compressible Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate that AIMEX schemes can significantly outperform classical explicit Runge-Kutta schemes by over a factor of 20, and conventional IMEX schemes by over a factor of two, with negligible impact on quantitative results. Finally, a demonstration case of Implicit Large Eddy Simulation (ILES) of flow over a stalled NACA0020 airfoil shows the utility of AIMEX schemes for wall-bounded turbulent flows.},

  abstract = {Plastic pollution presents a global environmental concern with potentially widespread ecological, socioeconomic and health implications. Methodological advances in microplastic extraction, quantification and identification from sediments have been made. However, integrating these fragmentary advances into a holistic, cost-effective protocol and applying it to organic rich sediments with fine grain size remains a challenge. Nonetheless, many hot spots of microplastic contamination such as harbour and estuarine sediments are characterised by such sediments. We conducted a series of experiments to integrate methodological advances, and clarify their applicability to organic rich sediments with fine grain size. The resulting protocol consisted of three stages. First, pre-treatment with Fenton's reagent was found to be efficient in reducing organic matter content, compatible with later Fourier TransformInfrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) for polymer identification, although it did affect the size of polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Secondly, a novel density separation column with a top overflow (the OC-T) obtained recovery rates above 90\% for microplastics present in a ZnCL2 solution. Finally, automated epifluorescence microscopic image analysis of Nile Red stained filters with selected validation of polymer identities using FT-IR revealed 91.7\% of stained particles to be plastics. A case study on estuarine sediments demonstrated a high extraction efficiency with quantification possible down to 125 mm and detection possible down to 62.5 mm. This makes this protocol suitable for large scale monitoring of microplastics in sediments of estuarine origin provided polymer specific recovery rates, background contamination and uncertainty in Nile Red identification is accounted for. Subject to further validation, the protocol could also offer a solution to similar organic rich sediments with fine grain size, such as some soils and sludge, to improve our ability to conduct cost-effective, large scale monitoring of microplastic contamination.},

  abstract = {Monitoring sediment yields from catchments is important for assessing overall denudation rates and the impact of environmental change. One of the methods used to assess sediment yield is by quantifying sedimentation rates in reservoirs, lakes or small ponds. Before reliable sediment yield values (t ha-1 a-1) can be computed from such sedimentation records, the measured sediment volumes need to be converted to sediment masses using representative values of the dry sediment bulk density. In textbooks, simple relations predicting dry sediment bulk density from sediment texture, time since deposition and hydrologic condition are presented. In this study, 13 small flood retention ponds in central Belgium were sampled to reveal the variability in dry sediment bulk density and to test the commonly used relations to predict dry sediment bulk density. Dry sediment bulk density varies not only between the selected ponds (0{$\cdot$}78{\textendash}1{$\cdot$}35 t m-3) but also within individual ponds (coefficient of variation at 95 per cent ranges from 7 to 80 per cent). The observed variability can be attributed primarily to the hydrologic condition of the retention pond and, also, to sediment texture. The existing relations are not a reliable predictor for the observed dry bulk densities, because they are primarily based on sediment texture. Thus, when using volumetric sedimentation data from small ponds with varying hydrologic condition to predict sediment yield, existing relations predicting dry sediment bulk density cannot be applied. Instead, frequent and dense sampling of sediments is necessary to calculate a representative value of the dry sediment bulk density. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {A new adaptive hybrid optimization strategy, entitled squads, is proposed for complex inverse analysis of computationally intensive physics-based models. Typically, models are calibrated and model parameters are estimated by minimization of the discrepancy between model simulations characterizing the system and existing observations requiring a substantial number of model evaluations. Squads is designed to be computationally efficient and robust in identification of the global optimum (i.e. maximum or minimum value of an objective function). It integrates global and local optimization using Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) and Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt (LM) optimization using adaptive rules based on runtime performance. The global strategy (APSO) optimizes the location of a set of solutions (particles) in the parameter space. The local strategy (LM) is applied only to a subset of the particles at different stages of the optimization based on the adaptive rules. After the LM adjustment of the subset of particle positions, the updated particles are returned to APSO. Therefore, squads is a global strategy that utilizes a local optimization speedup. The advantages of coupling APSO and LM in the manner implemented in squads is demonstrated by comparisons of squads performance against Levenberg{\textendash}Marquardt (LM), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO; i.e. TRIBES), and an existing hybrid optimization strategy (hPSO). All the strategies are tested on 2D, 5D and 10D Rosenbrock and Griewank polynomial test functions and a synthetic hydrogeologic application to identify the source of a contaminant plume in an aquifer. Tests are performed using a series of runs with random initial guesses for the estimated parameters. The performance of the strategies are compared based on their robustness, defined as the percentage of runs that identify the global optimum, and their efficiency, quantified by a statistical representation of the number of function evaluations performed prior to identification of the global optimum. Squads is observed to have better performance than the other strategies for the test functions and the hydrogeologic application when both robustness and efficiency are taken into consideration.},

  abstract = {Numerical modelling is now used routinely to make predictions about the behaviour of environmental systems. Model calibration remains a critical step in the modelling process and different approaches have been taken to develop guidelines to support engineers and scientists in this task. This article reviews currently available guidelines for a river hydraulics modeller by dividing them into three types: on the calibration process, on hydraulic parameters, and on the use of hydraulic simulation codes. The article then presents an integration of selected guidelines within a knowledge-based calibration support system. A prototype called CaRMA-1 (Calibration of River Model Assistant) has been developed for supporting the calibration of models based on a specific 1D code. Two case studies illustrate the ability of the prototype to face operational situations in river hydraulics engineering, for which both data quality and quantity are not sufficient for an optimal calibration. Using CaRMA-1 allows the modeller to achieve the calibration task in accordance with good calibration practice implemented in the knowledge base. Relevant reasoning rules can easily be added to the knowledge base to extend the prototype range of applications. This study thus provides a framework for building operational support tools from various types of existing engineering guidelines.},

In comparison with other comprehensive modeling systems (Delft-3D, Mike-21, etc.), the main originality lies in the efficiency and flexibility of the finite elements. Thanks to the optimization of numerical schemes, parallelism, as well as tremendous progress in the performance of computers, bed evolution can be calculated on basin scale (10{\textendash}100 km) and for the medium term (years to decades), without the use of hydrodynamic filtering methods.

Flow observations across the SWI are critical in the description of these transport processes but are currently very limited as the sediment bed is inaccessible in most experimental approaches. We overcome this constraint by combining refractive-index matching (RIM) with particle-tracking velocimetry (PTV). Using measurements of the flow dynamics across the SWI, we propose a mechanistic model that describes the interfacial mass transport over a wide and relevant parameter space. We show there are three transport regimes where molecular, dispersive, or turbulent transport dominates the mass flux of a passive tracer across the SWI. Transitions between these regimes are defined by the permeability Reynolds number , where K is the sediment permeability, is the shear velocity, and {$\nu$} is the fluid viscosity. In the molecular regime ( ), mass transport is described by the molecular diffusion coefficient (D). In both the dispersive ( ) and turbulent regimes ( ), the mass diffusivity is directly proportional to . The model is strongly supported by an extensive data set of published interfacial mass flux observations and provides a tool for describing fluxes across the SWI in aquatic system models.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems provide a range of services, including water purification, erosion prevention, and flood risk mitigation, that are important to water resource managers. But as a sector, water resources management has been slow to incorporate ecosystem protection and restoration, for a variety of reasons, although related concepts such as nature-based solutions and green infrastructure are gaining traction. We explain some of the existing challenges to wider uptake of the ecosystem services concept in water resources management and introduce some promising avenues for research and practice, elaborated in more detail through 12 papers, spanning five continents and a variety of contexts, which make up a Special Issue on ``Incorporating Ecosystem Services into Water Resources Management''. Cross-cutting themes include (A) ecosystem services as a flexible concept to communicate with stakeholders; (B) participatory processes to involve stakeholders in research; (C) multiple values, and valuation methods, of water-related services; and (D) applications of decision-support tools. We conclude with a summary of research gaps and emphasize the importance of co-producing knowledge with decision makers and other stakeholders, in order to improve water resources management through the integration of ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Hydrological models generally contain parameters that cannot be measured directly, but can only be meaningfully inferred by calibration against a historical record of input{\textendash}output data. While considerable progress has been made in the development and application of automatic procedures for model calibration, such methods have received criticism for their lack of rigor in treating uncertainty in the parameter estimates. In this paper, we apply the recently developed Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis algorithm (SCEM-UA) to stochastic calibration of the parameters in the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model (SAC-SMA) model using historical data from the Leaf River in Mississippi. The SCEM-UA algorithm is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler that provides an estimate of the most likely parameter set and underlying posterior distribution within a single optimization run. In particular, we explore the relationship between the length and variability of the streamflow data and the Bayesian uncertainty associated with the SAC-SMA model parameters and compare SCEM-UA derived parameter values with those obtained using deterministic SCE-UA calibrations. Most significantly, for the Leaf River catchments under study our results demonstrate that most of the 13 SAC-SMA parameters are well identified by calibration to daily streamflow data suggesting that this data contains more information than has previously been reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {AbstractA method of achieving a dimensionless collapse of erosion-rate data for cohesive sediments is proposed and shown to work well for data collected in flume-erosion tests on mixtures of sand and mud (silt plus clay sized particles) for a wide range of mud fraction. The data collapse corresponds to a dimensional erosion law of the form E{$\sim$}({$\tau-\tau$}c)m, where E is erosion rate, {$\tau$} is shear stress, {$\tau$}c is the threshold shear stress for erosion to occur, and m{$\approx$}7/4. This result contrasts with the commonly assumed linear erosion law E=kd({$\tau-\tau$}c), where kd is a measure of how easily sediment is eroded. The data collapse prompts a re-examination of the way that results of the hole-erosion test (HET) and jet-erosion test (JET) are customarily analyzed, and also calls into question the meaningfulness not only of proposed empirical relationships between kd and {$\tau$}c, but also of the erodibility parameter kd itself. Fuller comparison of flume-erosion data with hole-erosion and jet-erosion data will require revised analyses o...},

However, rivers are often only seen as transport paths for MPs from inland sources to the oceans, although transport rates in rivers can hardly be determined yet. MP in rivers can either be transported, or it settles to the bottom of the river and either remains there or is remobilized again at higher flow velocities. This remobilization, also known as erosion, depends on the critical shear stress of a particle and is influenced by the particle properties and the sediment bed. In this study, the critical shear stresses of 14 MP particles with different shapes, densities, and particle sizes on different sediment beds were experimentally determined and subsequently compared with the basic principles of erosion from sediment transport. Critical shear stresses of the MP particles were between 0.002 and 0.233 N/m2, depending on particle and sediment properties. Furthermore, the hiding-exposure effect was transferred to MPs and an equation was developed to determine the critical shear stress of different MP particles on natural sediment beds.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of the biology, biochemistry, and genetic development of roots has considerably improved during the last decade (Smith and Fedoroff, 1995; Flores et al., 1999;Benfey and Scheres, 2000). In contrast, the processes mediated by roots in the rhizosphere such as the secretion of root border cells and root exudates are not yet well understood (Hawes et al., 2000). In addition to the classical roles of providing mechanical support and allowing water/nutrient uptake, roots also perform certain specialized roles, including the ability to synthesize, accumulate, and secrete a diverse array of compounds (Flores et al., 1999). Given the complexity and biodiversity of the underground world, roots are clearly not passive targets for soil organisms. Rather, the compounds secreted by plant roots serve important roles as chemical attractants and repellants in the rhizosphere, the narrow zone of soil immediately surrounding the root system (Estabrook and Yoder, 1998; Bais et al., 2001). The chemicals secreted into the soil by roots are broadly referred to as root exudates. Through the exudation of a wide variety of compounds, roots may regulate the soil microbial community in their immediate vicinity, cope with herbivores, encourage beneficial symbioses, change the chemical and physical properties of the soil, and inhibit the growth of competing plant species (Nardi et al., 2000; Fig. 1A). The ability to secrete a vast array of compounds into the rhizosphere is one of the most remarkable metabolic features of plant roots, with nearly 5\% to 21\% of all photosynthetically fixed carbon being transferred to the rhizosphere through root exudates (Marschner, 1995).Fig. 1.A, Representation of the complex interactions mediated by root exudates that take place in the rhizosphere between plant roots and other organisms.

Some recent advances in our understanding of the sediment delivery system and its modelling are described and the lack of detailed empirical investigations is highlighted. The significance of recent concern for the role of sediments in the transport of nutrients and contaminants to sediment delivery studies is introduced, and the need for further work in this field is emphasised.},

Such early work was hampered by lack of data for many areas of the world, but recent improvements in data availability now afford a meaningful basis for estimating the total suspended sediment flux from the land to the oceans and for establishing the global pattern of sediment yield and its major controls. The lack of long-term records for most rivers precludes detailed assessment of the role of anthropogenic activity in modifying the global denudation system but there is now a wide range of evidence to demonstrate the importance of such changes, in terms of both increases and decreases in sediment flux. Analysis of available longer-term records provides an important means of assessing the sensitivity of sediment yields to environmental change, which in turn requires consideration of the impact of both human activity and climate change.},

  abstract = {The temperature of river water plays a crucial role in many physical, chemical, and aquatic ecological processes. Despite the importance of having detailed information on this environmental variable at locally relevant scales ({$\leq$}50 km), high-resolution simulations of water temperature on a large scale are currently lacking. We have developed the dynamical 1-D water energy routing model (DynWat), that solves both the energy and water balance, to simulate river temperatures for the period 1960{\textendash}2014 at a nominal 10-km and 50-km resolution. The DynWat model accounts for surface water abstraction, reservoirs, riverine flooding, and formation of ice, enabling a realistic representation of the water temperature. We present a novel 10-km water temperature data set at the global scale for all major rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Validated results against 358 stations worldwide indicate a decrease in the simulated root-mean-square error (0.2 {\textdegree}C) and bias (0.7 {\textdegree}C), going from 50- to 10-km simulations. We find an average global increase in water temperature of 0.16 {\textdegree}C per decade between 1960 and 2014, with more rapid warming toward 2014. Results show increasing trends for the annual daily maxima in the Northern Hemisphere (0.62 {\textdegree}C per decade) and the annual daily minima in the Southern Hemisphere (0.45 {\textdegree}C per decade) for 1960{\textendash}2014. The high-resolution modeling framework not only improves the model performance, it also positively impacts the relevance of the simulations for regional-scale studies and impact assessments in a region without observations. The resulting global water temperature data set could help to improve the accuracy of decision-support systems that depend on water temperature estimates.},

In a traditional soil survey, each of the soil types (classes) is assigned with a soil erodibility value that is assumed to be constant over time. However, heterogeneity of soil in time and in space tends to support the concept that soil erodibility depends dynamically and spatially on the set of properties of a specific soil. This study statistically compared the published soil erodibility values with those from a set of soil samples in terms of their differences. The published values tend to underestimate soil erodibility. This feature is also supported by the uncertainty assessment in difference maps of the published K values versus those from soil samples. Spatial prediction and uncertainty analysis of the soil erodibility from the set of soil samples was carried out using a sequential Gaussian simulation. The results show that the simulation produces a reliable prediction map of soil erodibility and can be recommended as a monitoring strategy to spatially update soil erodibility.},

  abstract = {Identification and removal of surface depressions is a critical step for automated modelling of surface rainfall runoff based on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). At present, nearly all GIS and hydrologic software packages employ Jenson and Domingue's method for preparing depressionless DEMs for hydrologic analysis. This conventional method is computationally intensive and time-consuming. With the growing availability of high-resolution DEMs produced by airborne LIDAR and InSAR techniques, GIS-based hydrologic applications often need to handle larger geographic areas at finer resolutions. In the face of high-resolution DEMs, the conventional method becomes inadequate and deficient. In this paper, we present a new method for efficiently identifying and filling surface depressions in DEMs. This method can simultaneously determine flow paths and spatial partition of watersheds with one pass of processing. A novel concept of spill elevation and the least-cost search for optimal flow paths are the two cornerstones of our method. The time complexity of our method is in O(Nlog N). It has been implemented using C++ programming language and successfully applied to USGS DEMs and LIDAR DEMs of various sizes. Experiments show that our method outperforms the conventional method by a factor of over 30, in terms of running time.},

Using datasets of river water discharge, water consumption and regional precipitation for the past 50~years, we elucidate some connections between decreasing water discharges, global El Ni{\~n}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and anthropogenic impacts in the drainage basin. Global ENSO events, which directly affected the regional precipitation in the river basin, resulted in approximately 51\% decrease in river water discharge to the sea. The degree of anthropogenic impacts on river water discharge is now as great as that of natural influences, accelerating the water losses in the hydrological cycle. The large dams and reservoirs regulated the water discharge and reduced the peak flows by storing the water in the flood season and releasing it in the dry season as needed for agricultural irrigation. Thus, as a result, large dams and reservoirs have shifted the seasonal distribution patterns of water discharge and water consumption and finally resulted in rapidly increasing water consumption. Meanwhile, the annual distribution pattern of water consumption also changed under the regulation of dams and reservoirs, indicating that the people living in the river basin consume the water more and more to suit actual agricultural schedule rather than depending upon natural pattern of annual precipitation. The combination of the increasing water consumption facilitated by the dams and reservoirs and the decreasing precipitation closely associated with the global ENSO events over the past half century has resulted in water scarcity in this world-famous river, as well as in a number of subsequent serious results for the river, delta and coastal ocean.},

This research examines long-term morphodynamic evolution in the Yangtze Estuary from 1861 to 2002 and the equilibrium mechanism of the Xinqiao Channel in the Yangtze Estuary by digitizing 15 selected maritime charts and calculating the volume of the channel. Although the total period of channel development is much longer than the historical data used in this paper, three stages are identified during the study period: the first embryonic stage (66~years), the second formation stage (33~years) and the third equilibrium stage (45~years). Variations in coastline location, channel volume, and hydrodynamics in the channel during the three stages indicate that the channel equilibrium was reached and maintained when the channel direction was aligned with the direction of offshore tidal wave propagation. Variations in river and sediment discharges affect erosion and deposition in the channel and thus channel geometry. However, future reduction in sediment supply by 10{\textendash}33\% due to the ongoing river engineering projects would increase the volume of the Xinqiao Channel only by 1{\textendash}3\%. It seems unlikely that the above change in sediment discharge will disrupt the equilibrium of the Xinqiao Channel.},

Among the three methods, the SCE seems to be more robust than the other two approaches because of the smallest influence of different initial random number seeds on calibrated model parameters, and has the best performance of verification with a relatively small number of calibration events.

Based on the study of Whiting and Dietrich [20,21], we assess the capabilities of the Telemac-Mascaret modelling system [22] to reproduce twodimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) flow and morphodynamics structures in large-amplitude meandering channels. The large-amplitude meander setup of Whiting and Dietrich showed to be a difficult test for a depth-averaged 2-D model: even if appropriate parameterizations of relevant 3D effects are incorporated into the model, numerical simulations failed to capture some 3D patterns, such as the first well-defined pool observed in the experiments. However, 3D results obtained from the numerical solution of the RANS equations showed that most of the observed flow and morphodynamics patterns (e.g., series of shingled bars with pools along the concave bank, depositional bank fronts along the inner bank) are well captured by the model. In agreement with experimental observations, the bed topography in large amplitude symmetric planforms can be divided into different zones according to the different morphodynamics patterns: a zone with an almost zero bed load discharge and bed evolution, an ``alternate bars'' zone, a ``shingle-bars zone'' and a ``multiplepools'' zone.},

Other main empirical results reveal that the impacts of climate change on the supply of hydropower generation in China will be noteworthy for the society. Different scenarios have different effects on hydropower generation, of which A2 scenario (pessimistic, high emission) has the largest.

It is necessary to introduce estimation through multi-objective parameters, which is often affected by noise in the data, into water quality models. This paper presents a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm, which is based on the Mahalanobis distance operation, mechanism of cardinality preference and advection-diffusion operator. The Mahalanobis distance operation can effectively reduce the influence of noise in the data on model calibration. The mechanism of cardinality preference and the use of the advection-diffusion operator can prevent non-dominated solutions from falling into the local optimum. Four cases were used to test the proposed approach. The first two cases with true Pareto fronts show that this approach can accurately estimate the true Pareto front with a good distribution, even in the presence of noise. Furthermore, the application of the approach was tested by the O'Connor model and Crops of Engineers Integrated Compartment Water Quality Model. We show that our approach can produce satisfactory results for the multi-objective calibration of complex water quality models. In general, the proposed approach can provide accurate and efficient parameter estimation in water quality models.},

Such mechanism can help the algorithm to escape local position. (2) when the individual is the best particle, it is combined with a randomly selected particle to generate a convex combination, after that opposite learning is adopted to get a reverse solution. This operation can maintain the diversity of population. Finally, CNPSO is compared with several algorithms in three experiments, and used to optimize the spring design problem.

Perennial warm-season grasses (WSGs) such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), can be grown on marginally productive and/or environmentally sensitive lands to meet growing bioenergy demands while reducing water runoff and soil erosion compared to current row crop systems. Quantifying the soil and water conservation effects of WSG when strategically placed on the landscape would help support decisions favoring both economic and environmental benefits. We used the Daily Erosion Project (DEP) to simulate the effects of WSGs on hillslope water runoff and soil loss for 2008{\textendash}2016 across eight major land resource areas (MLRA) in the Midwest United States. Four different scenarios (baseline or existing conditions and switchgrass grown on slopes {$\geq$}3\%, {$\geq$}6\%, and {$\geq$}10\%) were modeled. Across all hillslope groups replacing row crops with switchgrass reduced yearly water runoff and soil loss by 3.2\%{\textendash}12.1\% and 43.7\%{\textendash}95.5\% compared with the baseline levels, respectively. Water and soil conservation efficiency (water runoff reductions or soil loss reductions associated with 1\% increase in switchgrass coverage) increased with slope as 10\% {$>$} 6\% {$>$} 3\% for all MLRAs. Switchgrass replacement on slopes {$\geq$}10\% reduced average soil loss estimates as much as 22.6 Mg ha-1 year-1 for the most erosive MLRA (baseline soil erosion rate of 28.6 Mg ha-1 year-1) and resulted in all MLRA erosion estimates {$\leq$}6.0 Mg ha-1 year-1. For soil loss, an apparent interaction existed between slope group and total annual precipitation; as annual precipitation increased, the difference in soil loss between slope groups increased. Soil loss was more sensitive to these factors than was water runoff. Policy supporting a renewable energy industry while strategically improving soil and water resources seems globally advantageous.},

The channel response to these pulses included (a) large bedload transport rates, (b) bed aggradation, (c) fining of the bed surface, and (d) continuous formation and collapse of steps. In between pulses, the bed surface coarsened, and bedload transport rates dropped by several orders of magnitude. Steps continuously formed and collapsed during and shortly after the pulses, but their stability increased when the sediment feed was turned off. High pulse magnitude enhanced step formation, while low pulse frequency (i.e., long interpulse period) enhanced step stability. We back-calculated the threshold for motion based on measured bedload transport rates and bed shear stress. Changes in the threshold for motion were much larger than changes in bed surface slope. By accounting for energy dissipation through the effective slope based on flow resistance partitioning, a better prediction was obtained. The threshold for motion decreased following sediment pulses then increased immediately after and fluctuated until the next sediment pulse. Our results indicate that longitudinal width variations and episodic sediment supply are primary controls on the evolution of step-pool channels. Sediment feed magnitude affects mostly morphological changes, while sediment feed frequency controls channel stability.},

However, GHG emissions from high altitude saline lakes on the Tibetan Plateau are currently poorly constrained. In this study, we measured methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and their carbon stable isotope ({$\delta$}13C), and calculated diffusive water-to-air fluxes from two saline high-altitude lakes, Qinghai Lake and Hala Lake, located in northeast Tibetan Plateau in October 2020. The two lakes were mostly supersaturated in CH4 (89.8\%{\textendash}4623.9\% sat) and acted as sources of CH4 to the atmosphere. Conversely, more than 96\% investigated area of Qinghai Lake and all investigated area of Hala Lake was a sink of CO2. The average diffusive fluxes of CH4 and CO2 in the surface waters of Qinghai Lake were 34.51~{$\mu$}mol~m-2~d-1 and -1.29~mmol~m-2~d-1, while diffusive fluxes of CH4 and CO2 in Hala Lake averaged 5.48~{$\mu$}mol~m-2~d-1 and -5.24~mmol~m-2~d-1, respectively. Salinity (Sal), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), temperature (Temp) and dissolved oxygen (DO) are key factors for diffusive CH4 and CO2 flux in Qinghai Lake and Hala Lake. CH4 diffusive fluxes across water{\textendash}air interface from Qinghai Lake and Hala Lake were found to be significantly lower than other freshwater lakes, likely due to their saline nature. A simple isotope mixing model (Miller{\textendash}Tans plots) revealed a distinctly different isotopic source values of CO2 and CH4 in Qinghai Lake and Hala Lake. The CH4 production pathway of Qinghai Lake was mainly by the acetate fermentation, while that of Hala Lake was mainly by the CO2 reduction. The results show that the continuous measurement can help capture the spatial variability of GHGs fluxes in saline lakes.},

  abstract = {Forests are an important natural resource, vital to all life. Forests are an important source of food, clothing, and medicines, as well as a place to live. Water released from forests drains into the soil causing groundwater to emerge as stream flow throughout the year. In Thailand, most forests have been encroached by logging, paper production, and housing construction. Population growth and the need for farming area for crop and livestock production have also caused forest encroachment. Technical tools are needed to support the decision makers and planners if they are to achieve objectives of water conservation, and development. These technical tools are needed for assistance in the engineering, socio-economic, and environmental planning. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used in the hydrological modeling in this study of the complex and dynamic problems of The Upper Nan river basin. This was a case study to evaluate the impact of changing conditions in the river basin affected by the stream flow due to reforestation. The watershed area was delineated into 5 sub-watersheds based on surface topography provided by the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and the parameters of each of these watersheds were calculated. The land use data was processed and reclassified to match with the SWAT model land use code. Ten different categories of land use in the study area were used for SWAT processing. Types of land use consist of: mixed forest (33. 7\%), disturbed forest (30. 2\%), evergreen forest(17. 7\%), paddy field(7. 1\%), orchard(3. 7\%), range brush(2. 7 \%), field crop(1. 7\%), planted forest (1. 7\%), urban (1. 4\%) and water resources (0. 4\%) . Twenty-two types of soil were found in the basin. The initial curve number values were assigned based on the land use type and soil hydrologic group for the average antecedent moisture condition of the curve number method. The potential evapotranspiration was computed using the Penman-Monteith method. The simulation was performed using three reforestation scenarios to assess stream flow:(1) improved disturbed forest, (2) field crops and range grass, and (3) both disturbed forest and field crops. The results of reforestation from scenarios 1 and 3 can increase stream flow in the drought season and can also reduce the flow in the wet season in the main stream and its tributaries. For scenario 2 Reforestation had no significant effect on the main stream.},

This equation expresses the pressure drop per unit length as a function of the absolute viscosity and mass density of the fluid and the macroscopic velocity. Because this equation is dimensionally homogeneous, any consistent set of units (cgs, etc.) may be used. All of the experimental data are represented on a plot of the Fanning friction factor for porous media versus the Reynolds number for porous media, in which the characteristic length, in both cases, is the square root of the permeability. The analogy between this plot and similar plots for circular pipes is noted together with the differences. The relationship between filtration and sedimentation is also shown. Water was the fluid used in all of the experimental runs. Glass beads, ion exchange resin, sand, gravel, anthracite coal, and granular activated carbon were the porous media used; all of these media are commercially available. Some of the glass beads media were approximately uniform in size.},

We examine the challenges faced by policymakers when coping with uncertainties and provide an action perspective on how to best cope with these challenges to inform the policy debate. Integrating social and natural scientist's perspectives on uncertainties and learning theories, we present a holistic, management perspective for coping with uncertainty. Based on a literature review about uncertainty concepts, strategies and learning, we identify three challenges in current river management: balancing social and technical uncertainties, being conservative and avoiding to end up a lock-in situation. We then provide a step-wise strategy and concrete actions for policymakers, which are illustrated with several examples. We conclude that coping with uncertainty may require paradigm shifts that can only be achieved through organisational learning. This, we claim, requires reflection, learning and flexibility of policymakers and their organisation.},

The method is used to solve for the parameters after formulating the calibration problem as a generalized linear inverse problem. Singular value decomposition is useful in solving underdetermined, overdetermined or even-determined problems, and can provide information to compute matrices describing parameter resolution, covariance, and correlation. This information is useful in identifying the important parameter groups in the model. Calibration is repeated with different numbers of parameter groups to determine the variation of the output error and uncertainty of the parameters with the parameter dimension. For purposes of comparison, the model with a selected group of parameters is calibrated using the Gauss-Newton method and minimax methods. The study shows the relationship of the parameters to the geometric layout of the river and the gauging stations.},

  abstract = {Renewable sources of electricity, such as solar and wind, need to be paired with sources of reliable baseload. Hydropower is a renewable, low-emission source of electricity baseload available throughout much of the world as an alternative to electricity conventionally provided by thermal combustion of fossil fuels; however, the global hydropower sector as it stands relies upon surface water flows of substantial and predictable volume. This makes it vulnerable to climate change. The impact of climate change on the hydropower sector is difficult to predict, and not globally uniform. It might be positive, negative, or inconsequential depending upon the local timing and magnitude of changes, reservoir size, allocation priority, and the energy market. The secondary effects of climate change on glacier lake outbursts floods, landslides, and sediment load are poorly understood. In addition, when planning hydropower projects for the future, attention must be given to the greenhouse gas contribution of the impounded waters behind storage dams, and the impact of dams on water temperature. In the past decade, sovereign nations and international development agencies worldwide have evaluated the potential of hydropower as a cost-effective, clean, sustainable option for baseload electricity supply. There is therefore a crucial need to assess the opportunities and risks hydropower poses across a wide range of potential future climate conditions. This review paper conducts a global survey of the literature on the effect of climate change on hydropower and identifies room for improvement in current approaches to evaluation of the net benefits of hydropower projects under climate change.

Detailed records collected from the regulated River Haddeo and the neighbouring (unregulated) River Pulham in a 14-year period following the attainment of top water level in the reservoir (Wimbleball Lake) show that the main thermal effects of impoundment and regulation have been to raise mean water temperature, eliminate freezing conditions, depress summer maximum values, delay the annual cycle and reduce diurnal fluctuation. However, the study also highlights pronounced year-to-year contrasts in the thermal impact of river impoundment and regulation. These can largely be explained with reference to inter-annual variations in both reservoir operation and weather conditions, which primarily control the amount of water released in summer months, and the volume of flow passing the spillway in the winter period, respectively.},

  abstract = {Combining air-water equilibrators with a field deployable cavity enhanced laser absorption spectrometer (CELAS) can generate precise, high resolution, measurements of dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations and {$\delta$}13C values in aquatic systems. However, equilibration response times for combined measurements of CO2 and CH4 isotopologues have not been assessed. We performed laboratory step experiments on six different equilibrators to constrain CO2 and CH4 equilibration time constants ({$\tau$}; high-to-low exponential decay constant). Three equilibrator types were then used in field-based step experiments to determine {$\tau$} for the individual isotopologues 12CO2, 13CO2, 12CH4, and 13CH4. In the laboratory experiments, {$\tau$} ranged from 34{\textendash}124 s for CO2 and 117{\textendash}2041 s for CH4 among the six equilibrators. The ratio between response times of CO2 and CH4 was substantially lower in the membrane type equilibrators ({$\tau$}-CH4 {$\sim$}5 times {$>$} {$\tau$}-CO2) than in the showerhead and marble types ({$\tau$}-CH4 {$\sim$}15 times {$>$} {$\tau$}-CO2). Individual isotopologue time constants under a water flow rate of {$\sim$}5.5 L min-1 ranged from 33.7{\textendash}43.1 s for 12CO2 and 13CO2, and 177{\textendash}347 s for 12CH4, and 13CH4. The {$\tau$} of CO2 isotopologues were within 1 s while {$\tau$} of CH4 isotopologues were the same. Further investigations into water flow rate revealed an exponential decrease in equilibration time from 1.5 L min-1 to 9 L min-1 in a marble-type equilibrator. The response time was always longer from high-to-low than low-to-high concentrations. By taking into consideration the equilibration response time, measurements of CO2, CH4, {$\delta$}13C-CO2, and {$\delta$}13C-CH4 can be resolved in near real-time using appropriate water-air equilibration devices.},

The mesoscale (100{\textendash}102 m) represents an intermediate resolution in modelling that bridges the gap between available resources and conservation efforts for riverine species. However, existing mesohabitat classification schemes for lotic systems vary significantly in the definition of habitat types as well as in their application in the field. This article aims to provide an overview of current attempts to model the mesoscale pattern of physical habitats with a focus on fish. First, we outline descriptive, qualitative as well as objective, quantitative classification methods that are available in the literature. Next, the ecological relevance of the mesohabitat concept is being discussed, using single-species and community-level approaches as examples. Different modelling approaches that describe and quantify riverine mesohabitats are presented, and finally, limitations and uncertainties in the modelling process are discussed, followed by an outline of future perspectives in mesohabitat modelling.},

  abstract = {The rewetting of drained peatlands alters peat geochemistry and often leads to sustained elevated methane emission. Although this methane is produced entirely by microbial activity, the distribution and abundance of methane-cycling microbes in rewetted peatlands, especially in fens, is rarely described. In this study, we compare the community composition and abundance of methane-cycling microbes in relation to peat porewater geochemistry in two rewetted fens in northeastern Germany, a coastal brackish fen and a freshwater riparian fen, with known high methane fluxes. We utilized 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on 16S rRNA, mcrA, and pmoA genes to determine microbial community composition and the abundance of total bacteria, methanogens, and methanotrophs. Electrical conductivity (EC) was more than 3 times higher in the coastal fen than in the riparian fen, averaging 5.3 and 1.5\&thinsp;mS cm-1, respectively. Porewater concentrations of terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) varied within and among the fens. This was also reflected in similarly high intra- and inter-site variations of microbial community composition. Despite these differences in environmental conditions and electron acceptor availability, we found a low abundance of methanotrophs and a high abundance of methanogens, represented in particular by Methanosaetaceae, in both fens. This suggests that rapid (re)establishment of methanogens and slow (re)establishment of methanotrophs contributes to prolonged increased methane emissions following rewetting.},

  abstract = {Shallow reservoirs are often used as sediment traps or storage basins, in which sedimentation depends on the flow pattern. Short rectangular reservoirs reveal a straight jet from inlet to outlet with identical recirculation zones on both sides. In longer reservoirs, the main jet reattaches to the side of the reservoir leading to small and large recirculation zones. Previous studies have found an empirical geometric relation describing the switch between these two flow patterns. In this study, we demonstrate, with a simple analytical model, that this switch coincides with a maximization of energy dissipation in the shear layer between the main jet and recirculation zones: short reservoirs dissipate more energy when the flow pattern is symmetric, while longer reservoirs dissipate more energy with an asymmetric pattern. This approach enables the prediction of the flow patterns without detailed knowledge of small scale processes, potentially useful in the early phase of reservoir design.},

  abstract = {The accumulation of fine sediments in rivers is a pernicious problem with wide-ranging consequences for the healthy functioning of rivers throughout the world. It is linked to a range of landuse changes and human activities that have increased sediment inputs leading to elevated fine sediment loads that exceed the sediment transport capacities of rivers. Surficial deposits of fine material can also create the conditions for fine sediment to move into and accumulate within the coarser bed substrate, a process known as colmation and the focus of this review. Colmation, also referred to as clogging, fine sediment infiltration, fine sediment deposition, ingress, infilling, intrusion of fines, siltation, and the surface{\textendash}subsurface exchange of particles, is particularly damaging to river habitats and ecosystems. It causes degradation through the physical effects of reduced porosity and flow connectivity and the biogeochemical changes arising from the hydraulic and hydrological impacts and the effects of sediment-bound contaminants, all of which can impact on river ecology. Different aspects of the phenomenon of colmation have been studied across a number of disciplines and over several decades and this paper synthesizes this wide literature to provide a multidisciplinary perspective on the mechanisms, causes, and impacts of colmation and discusses some key management challenges.

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model was implemented in the Beaver Reservoir Watershed of Northwest Arkansas. The objectives were to: (1) provide detailed information on calibrating and applying a multisite and multivariable SWAT model; (2) conduct sensitivity analysis; and (3) perform calibration and validation at three different sites for flow, sediment, total phosphorus (TP), and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) plus nitritenitrogen (NO2-N). Relative sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify parameters that most influenced predicted flow, sediment, and nutrient model outputs. A multiobjective function was defined that consisted of optimizing three statistics: percent relative error (RE), Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient (RNS2), and coefficient of determination (R2). This function was used to successfully calibrate and validate a SWAT model of Beaver Reservoir Watershed at multisites while considering multivariables. Calibration and validation of the model is a key factor in reducing uncertainty and increasing user confidence in its predictive abilities, which makes the application of the model effective. Information on calibration and validation of multisite, multivariable SWAT models has been provided to assist watershed modelers in developing their models to achieve watershed management goals.},

Thus, sediment yield can vary greatly from year to year with variation in climate, land use, and land management. A range of estimation techniques have been developed ranging from simple empirical relationships between sediment yield and river flow or basin characteristics, through methods to scale soil erosion estimates or measurements using delivery ratios, to physically based distributed models. Descriptions of the various approaches, together with advantages and shortcomings of these methods, are given. For prediction of future sediment yields, the uncertainties are even greater as climate and land-use pressures are not easily defined for hypothetical situations. Here, recommendations are made to incorporate uncertainty into the prediction and decision-making process.},

It is open-source and released under the GNU General Public License in a publicly available software repository that includes detailed documentation and tutorial DSMC gas flow cases. This release of the code includes many features not found in standard dsmcFoam, such as molecular vibrational and electronic energy modes, chemical reactions, and subsonic pressure boundary conditions. Since dsmcFoam+ is designed entirely within OpenFOAM's C++ object-oriented framework, it benefits from a number of key features: the code emphasises extensibility and flexibility so it is aimed first and foremost as a research tool for DSMC, allowing new models and test cases to be developed and tested rapidly. All DSMC cases are as straightforward as setting up any standard OpenFOAM case, as dsmcFoam+ relies upon the standard OpenFOAM dictionary based directory structure. This ensures that useful pre- and post-processing capabilities provided by OpenFOAM remain available even though the fully Lagrangian nature of a DSMC simulation is not typical of most OpenFOAM applications. We show that dsmcFoam+ compares well to other well-known DSMC codes and to analytical solutions in terms of benchmark results.

Ripples with wavelengths that are roughly proportional to grain size and nearly independent of orbital diameter (anorbital ripples), which predominate in the field, have heights at least several times smaller than wave boundary layer thickness. Relating wave boundary layer height to the generally more easily estimated wave orbital diameter, a set of expressions are developed for predicting ripple type and geometry based on mean grain size, wave orbital diameter, and estimated anorbital ripple height. This method provides a good characterization of ripple wavelength and steepness for a large set of combined field and flume data.},

  abstract = {Five erosion devices were compared using five intertidal estuarine sites covering a range of sediment stability from newly settled mud to very cohesive mud at the margins of a saltmarsh. The erosion devices use different methods of fluid shearing from horizontal currents/bed shear stresses to vertical water jets, and have different `footprint' areas. The devices included: (1) the annular flumes (AFs{\textemdash}diameter 64 cm; footprint area 0.17 m2) of the Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML); (2) PML's mini-annular flume (MAF{\textemdash}diameter 19 cm; area 0.026 m2); (3) the annular mini-flume (AMF{\textemdash}diameter 30.5 cm; area 0.032 m2) of the National Oceanography Centre Southampton (NOC); (4) NOC's Cohesive Strength Meter (CSM{\textemdash}diameter 3 cm; area 0.0007 m2); (5) NOC's EROMES (ER{\textemdash}diameter 10 cm; area 0.0079 m2). The quantification of threshold shear stress for bed erosion (te) and sediment erosion rate was complemented by the measurement of physical, chemical and biological properties of the sediment (grain size, bulk density, water content, organic content, chlorophyll a, carbohydrates, macrofauna). The results demonstrated a significant correlation (r2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.98) between the PML AF (laboratory measurement of undisturbed cored sediment) and PML MAF (in situ) for measurement of erosion thresholds for bed sediment. However, there were no significant correlations between AFs, the CSM and EROMES. There were no consistent correlations with physical or biological sediment properties due to the spatially unrelated sites and the marked differences in benthic assemblages. The sources of differences and the lack of correlations between erosion devices were due to several factors, including operational procedures (e.g., sediment resuspension during filling with water), definition of erosion threshold, the nature of the force applied to the bed, and method of calibration. In contrast to the CSM and EROMES, both types of AFs were able to record significant differences in the erodability of soft sediments from four sites. This indicates that the CSM and EROMES may not be very effective at measuring the differences in erosion thresholds of soft estuarine sediments.},

  abstract = {For the understanding of morphological processes, it is not sufficient to only investigate river sections. On the macro scale, the catchment plays an important role especially for the available quantity of material fluxes and its composition in the river. Intense river works in the last decades and centuries (straightening, reservoirs, dams, dikes etc.) strongly alter the characteristics of our rivers. In particular, the lack of bed load material severely affects the dynamic processes in rivers and ecological important instream structures. In some examples, the attempt is made to enhance the ecological situation in a river by individual river restoration measures. Depending on the availability of material, very different results can be achieved. These effects can also be proven very well with the help of long-term morphological models. Another option is to bring back sediments into the transport cycle, e.g. by flushing reservoirs. On one hand, this can help to increase the morphological dynamics, but on the other hand the grain sorting effect upstream of reservoirs changes the characteristics of the river bed downstream. Due to changes of material composition, the granular structure on the micro and pico-scale of the river bed may be heavily altered. It occurs that, although the meso-scale structure seems to be good, there are still not enough acceptable habitats for aquatic species available. However, alterations on the micro and pico-scale, like colmation and clogging processes, e.g. due to flushing of reservoirs or changes in wash load fluxes from the catchment, can influence the biological communities in rivers. Depending on sediment texture and content of pollutants and/or nutrients, effects like biofilm growth occur, which then additionally alter sediment transport characteristics.},

Fractional transport rates are referenced to the size distribution of the bed surface, rather than subsurface, making the model completely explicit and capable of predicting transient conditions. The model is developed using a new data set of 48 coupled observations of flow, transport, and bed surface grain size using five different sediments. The model incorporates a hiding function that resolves discrepancies observed among earlier hiding functions. The model uses the full size distribution of the bed surface, including sand, and incorporates a nonlinear effect of sand content on gravel transport rate not included in previous models. The model shares some common elements with two previous surface-based transport models, but differs in using the full surface size distribution and in that it is directly developed from a relatively comprehensive data set with unambiguous measurement of surface grain size over a range of flow, transport rate, and sediments.},

  abstract = {Reservoir sedimentation results in ongoing loss of storage capacity all around the world. Thus, effective sediment management in reservoirs is becoming an increasingly important task requiring detailed process understanding. Computational fluid dynamics modelling can provide an efficient means to study relevant processes. An existing in-house hydrodynamic code has been extended to model particle-driven gravity currents. This has been realised through a buoyancy term which was added as a source term to the momentum equation. The model was successfully verified and validated using literature data of lock exchange experiments. In addition, the capability of the model to optimize venting of turbidity currents as an efficient sediment management strategy for reservoirs was tested. The results show that the concentration field during venting agrees well with observations from laboratory experiments documented in literature. The relevance of particle-driven gravity currents for the flow field in reservoirs is shown by comparing results of simulations with and without buoyant forces included into the model. The accuracy of the model in the area of the bottom outlet can possibly be improved through the implementation of a non-upwind scheme for the advection of velocity.},

This first systematic assessment of the uncertainties, problems and issues associated with achieving reliable and repeatable measurement with this technique presents the adaptation, measurement range, calibration and maintenance, accuracy and issues of efficient operation, for one example instrument. Regular open-loop calibration, a precise loop volume estimate, leak free system, and a high standard of injection practices are necessary for accurate results. For 100 {$\mu$}l injections, measured values ranging from 4.5 to 9 x104 ppm (CH4), and 1000 ppm to 1 x106 ppm (CO2) are possible with uncertainties {$\pm$}5.9\% and {$\pm$}3.0\%, respectively, beyond 100 ppm CH4 correction may be necessary. Uncertainty arising from variations water vapour content and atmospheric pressure are small (0.24\% and -0.9\% to +0.5\%, respectively). With good practice, individual operator repeatability of 1.9\% (CH4) and 2.48\% (CO2) can be achieved. Between operator injection error was around 3\% for both gases for four operators. Slow syringe plunger operation ({$>$} 1s) is recommended; generally delivered more (ca. 3{\textendash}4\%) sample into the closed instrument loop than did rapid operation. Automated value retrieval is recommended; we achieved a 3 to 5-fold time reduction for each injection cycle (ca. {$<$}2 min), and operator reading, recording, and digitization errors are eliminated.},

This study uses an enlarged data set to (1) compare measured meander geometry to that predicted by the Langbein and Leopold (1966)theory, (2) examine the frequency distribution of the ratio radius of curvature/channel width, and (3) derive 40 empirical equations (31 of which are original) involving meander and channel size features. The data set, part of which comes from publications by other authors, consists of 194 sites from a large variety of physiographic environments in various countries. The Langbein-Leopold sine-generated-curve theory for predicting radius of curvature agrees very well with the field data (78 sites). The ratio radius of curvature/ channel width has a modal value in the range of 2 to 3, in accordance with earlier work; about one third of the 79 values is less than 2.0. The 40 empirical relations, most of which include only two variables, involve channel cross-section dimensions (bankfull area, width, and mean depth) and meander features (wavelength, bend length, radius of curvature, and belt width). These relations have very high correlation coefficients, most being in the range of 0.95{\textasciitilde}.99. Although channel width traditionally has served as a scale indicator, bankfull cross-sectional area and mean depth also can be used for this purpose.},

  abstract = {Numerical morphological modelling of braided rivers is increasingly used to explore controls on river pattern and for applied environmental management. This article reviews and presents a taxonomy of braided river morphodynamic models and discusses the challenges facing model development and use, illustrating these challenges with a case example. The taxonomy is contextualised by an initial discussion of the physical mechanisms of braiding. The taxonomy differentiates between reach-scale and catchmentscale models. Reach-scale models are usually physics-based, which are further divided based upon the mathematical approach used to solve equations (analytical or numerical) and their dimensionality (1D, 2D or 3D). Cellular automata models are one type of numerical model that replace at least some physical processes with expedient rules. A 2D physics-based approach encapsulates sufficient process complexity to provide behavioural predictions. Predictions from catchment-scale landscape evolution models have potential for providing boundary conditions. Future progress in physics-based modelling needs to address three challenges: (i) representation of f low and sediment transport; (ii) temporal and spatial scaling; and (iii) model calibration, sensitivity, uncertainty and validation. The key problem for addressing these is the dearth of laboratory or natural experiment datasets. To show that progress can be made by comparing reach-scale predictions to high-resolution observations, a case study of monitoring and modelling, conducted in the Rees River, New Zealand, is presented. Hydraulic predictions of cellular automata and shallow water equation (Delft3d) models are compared to observed inundation extent. The efficacy of high-resolution, multi-temporal morphological data for assessing 2D physics-based morphodynamic model predictions is also demonstrated.},

Binary distillation column plant described by Wood and Berry (WB) having two inputs and two outputs and by Ogunnike and Ray (OR) having three inputs and three outputs are considered for the design of multivariable PID controller. Optimal centralized PID controller is designed by minimizing IAE for servo response with unit step change. Simulations are carried out using SIMULINKMATLAB software. The statistical performances of the designed controllers such as best, mean, standard deviations of IAE and average functional evaluations for 20 independent trials. For the purpose of comparison, recent version of real coded Genetic Algorithm (RGA) with simulated binary crossover (SBX) and conventional BLT method are used. In order to validate the performance of optimal PID controller for robustness against load disturbance rejection, load regulation experiment with step load disturbance is conducted. Also, to determine the performance of optimal PID controller for robustness against model uncertainty, servo and load response with +20\% variations in gains and dead times is conducted. Simulation results reveal that for both OR and WB systems, CMAES designed centralized PID controller is better than other methods and also it is more robust against model uncertainty and load disturbance.},

The data set was collected from a large-scale meandering channel with a self-formed fixed bed, and comprises detailed bed profiling and laser Doppler anemometer velocity measurements. Comparisons of the computed primary and secondary velocities are made with those observed and it is found that the lateral momentum transfer is generally under predicted. At the apices this results in the predicted position of the primary velocity maximum having a bias towards the channel center, compared to the position where it has been measured. Using a simplified two zone roughness distribution whereby a separate roughness height was prescribed for the channel center and channel sides relative to a single distributed roughness height, generally led to a slightly improved longitudinal velocity distribution; the higher velocities were located nearer to the outside of the bend. Improving both the free surface calculation and scheme for discretization of the convection terms led to no appreciable difference in the computed velocity distributions. A more detailed study involving turbulence measurements and bed form height distribution should discriminate whether using distributed roughness height is a precursor to using an anisotropic turbulence representation for the accurate prediction of three-dimensional river flows.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a three-dimensional model in an Eulerian reference frame for the evolution of the settling velocity of cohesive sediments in estuarine and coastal environments. The variation in settling velocity is the result of turbulence-induced aggregation and floc breakup processes. The mud flocs are treated as self-similar fractal entities because of which Stokes' formula relating settling velocity and floc size has to be modified. A new hindered settling formula is proposed which accounts for the gelling processes typical of cohesive sediment at high concentrations. When the floc concentration approaches unity, a space-filling network develops and the settling velocity becomes zero. This state of the suspension is often referred to as fluid mud. The flocculation model is implemented in a 1dv point model and applied to simulate the processes in a reach of the turbidity maximum in the Ems estuary, The Netherlands, where longitudinal gradients are small. The numerical results compare favourably with observed values of the vertical suspended sediment concentration, of the floc size and the fluid mud concentration. The model predicts large temporal variations in settling velocity and flocculation time, which explains why it was not possible to simulate the observed vertical profiles of suspended sediment concentration properly with a constant settling velocity.},

  abstract = {Water storage is an important way to cope with temporal variation in water supply and demand. The storage capacity and the lifetime of water storage reservoirs can be significantly reduced by the inflow of sediments. A global, spatially explicit assessment of reservoir storage loss in conjunction with vulnerability to storage loss has not been done. We estimated the loss in reservoir capacity for a global data set of large reservoirs from 1901 to 2010, using modeled sediment flux data. We use spatially explicit population data sets as a proxy for storage demand and calculate storage capacity for all river basins globally. Simulations suggest that the net reservoir capacity is declining as a result of sedimentation ({$\sim$}5\% compared to the installed capacity). Combined with increasing need for storage, these losses challenge the sustainable management of reservoir operation and water resources management in many regions. River basins that are most vulnerable include those with a strong seasonal flow pattern and high population growth rates such as the major river basins in India and China. Decreasing storage capacity globally suggests that the role of reservoir water storage in offsetting sea-level rise is likely weakening and may be changing sign.},

In an effort to frame a more inclusive paradigm for river management, we discuss sediment inputs, transport, and storage within river systems; interactions among water, sediment, and valley context; and the need to broaden the natural flow regime concept. Explicitly incorporating sediment is challenging, because sediment is supplied, transported, and stored by nonlinear and episodic processes operating at different temporal and spatial scales than water and because sediment regimes have been highly altered by humans. Nevertheless, managing for a desired balance between sediment supply and transport capacity is not only tractable, given current geomorphic process knowledge, but also essential because of the importance of sediment regimes to aquatic and riparian ecosystems, the physical template of which depends on sediment-driven river structure and function.}

Explicit characterization of connectivity helps understanding of disparities among short-term, local rates of flux and inferred fluxes over larger scales. Connectivity also strongly influences the response of rivers to natural and human disturbances. Investigations of connectivity facilitate the recognition of processes that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries, as well as understanding of nonlinear behavior and retention within rivers. Enhancing the ability to identify, quantify, and predict the processes that create and maintain connectivity is integral to the effective management of rivers.},

  abstract = {Large wood along rivers influences entrainment, transport, and storage of mineral sediment and particulate organic matter. We review how wood alters sediment dynamics and explore patterns among volumes of in-stream wood, sediment storage, and residual pools for dispersed pieces of wood, logjams, and beaver dams. We hypothesized that: volume of sediment per unit area of channel stored in association with wood is inversely proportional to drainage area; the form of sediment storage changes downstream; sediment storage correlates with wood load; the residual volume of pools created in association with wood correlates inversely with drainage area; and volume of sediment stored behind beaver dams correlates with pond area. Lack of data from larger drainage areas limits tests of these hypotheses, but the analyses suggest that sediment volume correlates positively with drainage area and wood volume. The form of sediment storage in relation to wood appears to change downstream, with wedges of sediment upstream from jammed steps most prevalent in small, steep channels and more dispersed sediment storage in lower gradient channels. Pool volume correlates positively with wood volume and negatively with channel gradient. Sediment volume correlates well with beaver pond area. More abundant in-stream wood and beaver populations present historically equated to greater sediment storage within river corridors and greater residual pool volume. One implication of these changes is that protecting and re-introducing wood and beavers can be used to restore rivers. This review of the existing literature on wood and sediment dynamics highlights the lack of studies on larger rivers. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Process-based river restoration seeks to restore processes such as channel-floodplain connectivity that create and maintain river corridor functions. Process-based restoration can fail to produce the desired results if geomorphic context is not effectively incorporated into restoration design. Geomorphic context of a river reach refers to the controls on contemporary river form and process. Controls at the catchment- to reach-scale include geologic history, biophysical characteristics, legacies of past human alterations, position within the river network, river corridor geometry, base level stability, disturbance regime, and contemporary human alterations of the river corridor. We conceptualize a river corridor as reflecting the interactions among fluxes of material and the geomorphic context. We discuss how an understanding of geomorphic context can be used to select a restoration approach and provide examples of how restoration can fail to achieve desired outcomes when geomorphic context is not considered. Within the toolbox of methods used to implement process-based restoration, we differentiate the alteration of inputs to the river corridor and fluxes of material through the corridor from alteration of form and/or connectivity within the river corridor. Historical, biotic, geologic/geomorphic, and reference sites can be used to inform process-based restoration targets. Restoration is strongly influenced by human perceptions of what is appropriate and achievable at a site and diverse communities influencing restoration at a site may differ in their perceptions. Geomorphically based conceptual guidelines, such as the River Styles Framework, provide an effective platform for incorporating an understanding of geomorphic context into process-based river restoration.},

An sfd algorithm assumes that subsurface flow occurs only in the steepest downslope direction from any given point; an mfd algorithm assumes that subsurface flow occurs in all downslope directions from any given point. The topographic index in TOPMODEL is ln (a/tan {$\beta$}), where In is the Napierian logarithm, a is the upslope area per unit contour length, and tan {$\beta$} is the slope gradient. The ln (a/tan{$\beta$}) distributions were computed from digital elevation model (DEM) data for locations with diverse topography in Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Vermont, and Virginia. The means of the ln (a/tan {$\beta$}) distributions were higher when the mfd algorithm was used for computation compared to when the sfd algorithm was used. The variances and skews of the distributions were lower for the mfd algorithm compared to the sfd algorithm. The differences between the mfd and sfd algorithms in the mean, variance, and skew of the ln (a/tan {$\beta$}) distribution were almost identical for the various DEMs and were not affected by DEM resolution or watershed size. TOPMODEL model efficiency and simulated flow paths were affected only slightly when the ln (a/tan {$\beta$}) distribution was computed with the sfd algorithm instead of the mfd algorithm. Any difference in the model efficiency and simulated flow paths between the sfd and mfd algorithms essentially disappeared when the model was calibrated by adjusting subsurface hydraulic parameters.},

Analysts can therefore be confused in performing a cross validation procedure. In this paper, the independence assumptions in cross validation are introduced, and the circumstances that satisfy the assumptions are also addressed. The independence assumptions are then used to derive the sampling distributions of the point estimators for k-fold and leave-one-out cross validation. The cross validation procedure to have such sampling distributions is discussed to provide new insights in evaluating the performance of classification algorithms.},

Geomorphic theory posits that ceteris paribus under a stationary flow and sediment regime, a river's channel pattern and its MU assemblage will also be stationary. This study tested that conjecture for the dynamic, gravel/cobble lower Yuba River. The MU assemblage consisting of eight in-channel bed types (i.e., chute, fast glide, pool/forced pool, riffle, riffle transition, run, slackwater, and slow glide) was mapped in 2006/2008 and 2014 for a {\textasciitilde}34~km long by 100~m wide alluvial segment at {\textasciitilde}1-m resolution using the Wyrick et al. (2014) methodology. Between these two surveys there were four brief floods of 6{\textendash}9 times bankfull discharge and a total of 163~days above bankfull discharge, yielding an estimated 638,539 and 507,743~m3 of erosion and deposition, respectively. Bulk statistical change tests (e.g., MU area, count, spacing, diversity, lateral diversity, and adjacency), MU temporal transition analysis, and MU individual polygon tracking analysis were used to answer the scientific question. Even though the river has an abundant internal sediment supply and dynamic flow regime, the river's in-channel bed shifted toward a lower-relief morphology, with a widespread and significant fragmentation of individual MU polygons, especially the large ones. The MU at each location in the river predominantly changed, except for pool, which tended to stay the same because of local topographic forcing. Overall, the predominance of evidence leads to the conclusion that the MU assemblage was not stationary over the period evaluated. This is hardly the final word, given the relatively short duration compared to geological time and considering only one cobble/gravel river, but this study points the way toward future investigation into MU stationarity in light of modern spatially explicit fluvial geomorphic mapping methods.},

  abstract = {One of the most important physical characteristics driving lifecycle events in lakes is stratification. Already subtle variations in the timing of stratification onset and break-up (phenology) are known to have major ecological effects, mainly by determining the availability of light, nutrients, carbon and oxygen to organisms. Despite its ecological importance, historic and future global changes in stratification phenology are unknown. Here, we used a lake-climate model ensemble and long-term observational data, to investigate changes in lake stratification phenology across the Northern Hemisphere from 1901 to 2099. Under the high-greenhouse-gas-emission scenario, stratification will begin 22.0\,{$\pm$}\,7.0 days earlier and end 11.3\,{$\pm$}\,4.7 days later by the end of this century. It is very likely that this 33.3\,{$\pm$}\,11.7 day prolongation in stratification will accelerate lake deoxygenation with subsequent effects on nutrient mineralization and phosphorus release from lake sediments. Further misalignment of lifecycle events, with possible irreversible changes for lake ecosystems, is also likely.},

The highest sand feed rate produced less sand infiltration into the subsurface deposits than the other two runs, which had approximately equivalent amounts of sand infiltration. Experimental data, combined with simple geometric relations and physical principles, are used to derive two relations describing the saturated fine sediment fraction in a gravel deposit and the vertical fine sediment fraction profile resulting from fine sediment infiltration. The vertical fine sediment fraction profile relation suggests that significant sand infiltration occurs only to a depth equivalent to a few median grain diameters of the bed material.},

Emphasis is placed on instrumentation techniques, as this is the area of suspended-sediment measurement that has the greatest potential for improving sediment data. Acoustic technology (if further developed) emerges as a promising technology because of its ability to measure the concentration profile without intruding into the flow. This technology-transfer information will be valuable to practitioners and researchers needing to choose a means of measuring suspended sediment.

  abstract = {Reliable predictions of sediment transport and river morphology in response to variations in natural and human-induced drivers are necessary for river engineering and management. Because engineering and management applications may span a wide range of space and time scales, a broad spectrum of modeling approaches has been developed, ranging from suspended-sediment ``rating curves'' to complex three-dimensional morphodynamic models. Suspended sediment rating curves are an attractive approach for evaluating changes in multi-year sediment budgets resulting from changes in flow regimes because they are simple to implement, computationally efficient, and the empirical parameters can be estimated from quantities that are commonly measured in the field (i.e., suspended sediment concentration and water discharge). However, the standard rating curve approach assumes a unique suspended sediment concentration for a given water discharge. This assumption is not valid in rivers where sediment supply varies enough to cause changes in particle size or changes in areal coverage of sediment on the bed; both of these changes cause variations in suspended sediment concentration for a given water discharge. More complex numerical models of hydraulics and morphodynamics have been developed to address such physical changes of the bed. This additional complexity comes at a cost in terms of computations as well as the type and amount of data required for model setup, calibration, and testing. Moreover, application of the resulting sediment-transport models may require observations of bed-sediment boundary conditions that require extensive (and expensive) observations or, alternatively, require the use of an additional model (subject to its own errors) merely to predict the bed-sediment boundary conditions for use by the transport model. In this paper we present a hybrid approach that combines aspects of the rating curve method and the more complex morphodynamic models. Our primary objective was to develop an approach complex enough to capture the processes related to sediment supply limitation but simple enough to allow for rapid calculations of multi-year sediment budgets. The approach relies on empirical relations between suspended sediment concentration and discharge but on a particle size specific basis and also tracks and incorporates the particle size distribution of the bed sediment. We have applied this approach to the Colorado River below Glen Canyon Dam (GCD), a reach that is particularly suited to such an approach because it is substantially sediment supply limited such that transport rates are strongly dependent on both water discharge and sediment supply. The results confirm the ability of the approach to simulate the effects of supply limitation, including periods of accumulation and bed fining as well as erosion and bed coarsening, using a very simple formulation. Although more empirical in nature than standard one-dimensional morphodynamic models, this alternative approach is attractive because its simplicity allows for rapid evaluation of multi-year sediment budgets under a range of flow regimes and sediment supply conditions, and also because it requires substantially less data for model setup and use.},

Suspended-load transport is simulated through the general convection-diffusion equation with an empirical settling-velocity term. This equation and the flow equations are solved numerically with a finite-volume method on an adaptive, nonstaggered grid.

  abstract = {In this study we incorporate the existing concept of fractional mobility into a stochastic framework for modeling the partial transport of mixed-size sediment. The model predicts the fractional transport rates with parameters such as the long-run moving probability, mean particle velocity, and fractional mobility, all varying with the dimensionless effective shear stress. Movement of bed load particles is treated as a random combination of single-step motions described by the pseudo four-state continuous-time Markov process whose long-run moving probability can be evaluated with the instantaneous entrainment probability and ratio of mean single-step holding time. A most updated version of entrainment probability taking into account both the rolling and lifting modes is adopted; the ratio of mean holding time is determined with a physically based relation derived experimentally. Two types of experiments are performed in this study: the colored bed experiments are carried out to observe the fractional mobility and partial transport; the plain bed experiments are conducted to observe the single-step bed load motions and mean particle velocity. The proposed model is widely tested with laboratory and field data pertaining to both partial and full transport conditions, and reasonably good agreement between the predicted and observed results is demonstrated. The model is then applied to evaluate the fractional mobility and explore the influence of sand content. The results reveal that the relation between fractional mobility and dimensionless effective shear stress is well approximated by the cumulative lognormal distribution, with its mean and standard deviation linearly decreasing with sand content for the range {$<$}0.34. The results imply that the existence of fine-grained sand in the gravel-sand mixture is favorable to the mobilization of sediment. At higher sand content the condition of partial transport exists within a narrower range of flows such that full transport is easier to achieve. The present study is the first to investigate the effect of sand content on the fractional mobility, thus providing new insights into the process of partial transport.},

  abstract = {Parameter optimization and uncertainty issues are a great challenge for the application of large environmental models like the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which is a physically-based hydrological model for simulating water and nutrient cycles at the watershed scale. In this study, we present a comprehensive modeling environment for SWAT, including automated calibration, and sensitivity and uncertainty analysis capabilities through integration with the R package Flexible Modeling Environment (FME). To address challenges (e.g., calling the model in R and transferring variables between Fortran and R) in developing such a two-language coupling framework, 1) we converted the Fortran-based SWAT model to an R function (R-SWAT) using the RFortran platform, and alternatively 2) we compiled SWAT as a Dynamic Link Library (DLL). We then wrapped SWAT (via R-SWAT) with FME to perform complex applications including parameter identifiability, inverse modeling, and sensitivity and uncertainty analysis in the R environment. The final R-SWAT-FME framework has the following key functionalities: automatic initialization of R, running Fortran-based SWAT and R commands in parallel, transferring parameters and model output between SWAT and R, and inverse modeling with visualization. To examine this framework and demonstrate how it works, a case study simulating streamflow in the Cedar River Basin in Iowa in the United Sates was used, and we compared it with the built-in auto-calibration tool of SWAT in parameter optimization. Results indicate that both methods performed well and similarly in searching a set of optimal parameters. Nonetheless, the R-SWAT-FME is more attractive due to its instant visualization, and potential to take advantage of other R packages (e.g., inverse modeling and statistical graphics). The methods presented in the paper are readily adaptable to other model applications that require capability for automated calibration, and sensitivity and uncertainty analysis.},

Therefore, the model validation of conditional expectations tells the discrepancy between the partial information of the computational model output and that of the observations. Then a calibration of the conditional expectations is carried out to reduce the value of model validation metric. After that, a recalculation of the model validation metric of model output is taken with the calibrated model parameters, and the result shows that a reduction of the discrepancy in the conditional expectations can help decrease the difference in model output.

  abstract = {The parameters of hydrological models are usually calibrated to achieve good performance, owing to the highly non-linear problem of hydrology process modelling. However, parameter calibration efficiency has a direct relation with parameter range. Furthermore, parameter range selection is affected by probability distribution of parameter values, parameter sensitivity, and correlation. A newly proposed method is employed to determine the optimal combination of multi-parameter ranges for improving the calibration of hydrological models. At first, the probability distribution was specified for each parameter of the model based on genetic algorithm (GA) calibration. Then, several ranges were selected for each parameter according to the corresponding probability distribution, and subsequently the optimal range was determined by comparing the model results calibrated with the different selected ranges. Next, parameter correlation and sensibility were evaluated by quantifying two indexes, RC Y, X and SE, which can be used to coordinate with the negatively correlated parameters to specify the optimal combination of ranges of all parameters for calibrating models. It is shown from the investigation that the probability distribution of calibrated values of any particular parameter in a Xinanjiang model approaches a normal or exponential distribution. The multi-parameter optimal range selection method is superior to the single-parameter one for calibrating hydrological models with multiple parameters. The combination of optimal ranges of all parameters is not the optimum inasmuch as some parameters have negative effects on other parameters. The application of the proposed methodology gives rise to an increase of 0.01 in minimum Nash{\textendash}Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS) compared with that of the pure GA method.},

However, the bioenergy development may potentially cause serious environmental alterations, which remain unclear. The study summarizes the environmental impacts of bioenergy production based on the compilation and published data. Our analysis shows that more and more attention is being paid to the environmental protection as the development of bioenergy, and among the influencing terms of bioenergy production, water issues (i.e., water quantity and quality) gain the greatest concern, whereas the least attention has been given to soil erosion. Although we recognize that the bioenergy production can indeed exert negative effects on the environment in terms of water quantity and quality, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity and soil organic carbon, and soil erosion, the adverse impacts varied greatly depending on biomass types, land locations, and management practices. Identifying the reasonable cultivation locations, appropriate bioenergy crop types, and optimal management practices can be beneficial to environment and sustainable development of bioenergy. In this field, Chinese bioenergy production has lagged behind and does not match its rising energy consumption, but it has a great potential of and demand for biomass-based energy especially under its urbanization, in spite of the negative environmental impacts. Therefore, this article is expected to serve as a reference and guideline on what has been done in the bioenergy-oriented countries that might stimulate development of more effective and environmentally sound guidelines for promoting bioenergy production in China and other developing countries as well.},

  abstract = {The impacts of precipitation and temperature on soil erosion are pronounced in mid-high latitude areas, which lead to seasonal variations in soil erosion. Determining the critical erosion periods and the reasons behind the increased erosion loads are essential for soil management decisions. Hence, integrated approaches combining experiments and modelling based on field investigations were applied to investigate watershed soil erosion characteristics and the dynamics of water movement through soils. Longterm and continuous data for surface runoff and soil erosion variation characteristics of uplands in a watershed were observed via five simulations by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). In addition, laboratory experiments were performed to quantify the actual soil infiltrabilities in snowmelt seasons (thawed treatment) and rainy seasons (non-frozen treatment). The results showed that over the course of a year, average surface runoff and soil erosion reached peak values of 31.38 mm and 1.46 t ha{\`A}1 a{\`A}1, respectively, in the month of April. They also ranked high in July and August, falling in the ranges of 23.73 mm to 24.91 mm and 0.55 t ha{\`A}1 a{\`A}1 to 0.59 t ha{\`A}1 a{\`A}1, respectively. With the infiltration time extended, thawed soils showed lower infiltrabilities than non-frozen soils, and the differences in soil infiltration amounts between these two were considerable. These results highlighted that soil erosion was very closely and positively correlated with surface runoff. Soil loss was higher in snowmelt periods than in rainy periods due to the higher surface runoff in early spring, and the decreased soil infiltrability in snowmelt periods contributed much to this higher surface runoff. These findings are helpful for identification of critical soil erosion periods when making soil management before critical months, especially those before snowmelt periods.},

  abstract = {Significant channel adjustments often occur during flood seasons in the Lower Yellow River (LYR), and it is a challenging work to accurately simulate the morphodynamic processes in the LYR using numerical models. A comparison of two morphodynamic models (Delft3D and 2DLLCDM) for the LYR is presented herein to identify critical improvements for these models. The concepts of these models are first compared with each other. The models were then used to simulate the processes of flood routing, sediment transport, and morphological changes occurring in a braided reach of the LYR. The differences were investigated between the simulated results from these models and corresponding field measurements, and the results indicate that: (1) the hydrodynamic processes calculated by both models agree closely with the measurements if an appropriate Manning's roughness coefficient is used; (2) the concentrations of suspended load at the downstream boundary calculated by the models agree reasonably with the observed data; and (3) the predicted cross-sectional profiles obtained from these models do not correspond well with the measurements. Based on these findings, the weak aspects of the models are clarified, and three critical improvements are recommended, including: (1) the development of roughness predictor; (2) the refinement of graded sediment transport capacity formulation; and (3) the consideration of bank erosion module. These improvements need to be implemented in the future.},

  abstract = {Process-based numerical models are frequently used by policymakers and water managers for decision-support in effective water quantity and quality management of urban water system reservoirs and lakes. Such models (e.g., Delft3D hydrodynamic and water quality models) typically involve systems of partial differential equations and are highly parameterized and expensive to compute. Hence, extensive human and computational effort for parameter calibration are required. Recent studies have demonstrated that High-Performance Computing (HPC) and efficient optimization techniques can be effective in automatic calibration and scenario optimization of computationally expensive environmental models. This study applies a parallel surrogate-assisted global optimization method within a simulation-optimization framework for efficient automatic calibration of computationally expensive lake hydrodynamic and water quality models. The simulation-optimization framework is implemented generically for Delft3D hydrodynamic and water quality models, and can also be applied to water quality planning and management optimization formulations. We apply our parallel framework for i) calibration of water temperature for a computationally expensive reservoir Delft3D hydrodynamics model (Delft3D-FLOW) and ii) multi-constituent (Chlorophyll-A, Total Nitrogen and Total Phosphorus) calibration of a reservoir Delft3D water quality model (Delft3D-WAQ). Both Delft3D models solve lots of partial differential equations and are expensive to compute. A single 1-year simulation of the hydrodynamics model with time step 1.5 minutes takes 4 to 5 hours on a Windows desktop with CPU Intel Core i7-4790. The reservoir water quality model requires 15-20 minutes for simulating given input from the hydrodynamics model. We ran our parallel calibration experiments on ASPIRE1 which is Singapore's first petascale supercomputer. Results indicate that our simulation-optimization framework performs considerably better and require significantly less computational and human effort (order of days) than manual calibration. A key purpose of this study is to illustrate (to policymakers and water managers) that efficient parallel surrogate-assisted simulation-optimization frameworks can be effectively used to calibrate the computationally expensive Delft3D models developed for Singapore's urban reservoirs with relatively few model evaluations. In future we plan to run these algorithms on Delft3D models asynchronously to further improve computational efficiency.},

A 3D hydrodynamic model [Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)] with major 3D flow features and different turbulence submodels was developed in a curvilinear, nonorthogonal coordinate system. A typical consecutive bend experiment was chosen as the verification case. A bend flow characteristic model with two turbulence submodels (k-{\guillemotleft} and shear-stress transport model) was developed using different grid mesh systems. A comparative assessment of the models was performed. The model verification was conducted by comparing the simulated velocity distribution, flow structure, and secondary current development with the experimental measurements. Differences between the simulations and measurements were observed when the secondary current or separation layer occurred. This indicates that the simulation accuracy in the high-sinuosity bends decreases with the development of channel bends. Comparison of the results obtained by the 3D RANS model with experimental and field data, and numerical predictions, validates that the k-{\guillemotleft} model with the fine-grid system is capable of simulating flow fields in curved open channels with reasonable accuracy.

  abstract = {Meandering is a common feature in natural alluvial streams. This study deals with alluvial behaviors of a meander reach subjected to both fresh-water flow and strong tides from the coast. Field measurements are carried out to obtain flow and sediment data. Approximately 95\% of the sediment in the river is suspended load of silt and clay. The results indicate that, due to the tidal currents, the flow velocity and sediment concentration are always out of phase with each other. The cross-sectional asymmetry and bi-directional flow result in higher sediment concentration along inner banks than along outer banks of the main stream. For a given location, the near-bed concentration is 2-5 times the surface value. Based on Froude number, a sediment carrying capacity formula is derived for the flood and ebb tides. The tidal flow stirs the sediment and modifies its concentration and transport. A 3D hydrodynamic model of flow and suspended sediment transport is established to compute the flow patterns and morphology changes. Cross-sectional currents, bed shear stress and erosion-deposition patterns are discussed. The flow in cross-section exhibits significant stratification and even an opposite flow direction during the tidal rise and fall; the vertical velocity profile deviates from the logarithmic distribution. During the flow reversal between flood and ebb tides, sediment deposits, which is affected by slack-water durations. The bed deformation is dependent on the meander asymmetry and the interaction between the fresh water flow and tides. The flood tides are attributable to the deposition, while the ebb tides, together with run-offs, lead to slight erosion. The flood tides play a key role in the morphodynamic changes of the meander reach.},

A new bank erosion model is also developed, which takes into consideration of the nonlinearity in near-bank velocity and the outer bank height. Simulations reproduce the long-term behavior of river meandering and floodplain evolution in a way very similar to their natural processes. Based on the simulation results, stability of river meandering dynamics is discussed and the concept of filtration effect is introduced to highlight meandering rivers' capability to filter out arbitrarily applied planform disturbance. Simulations are also carried out to investigate the influence of the velocity nonlinearity and the outer bank height in bank erosion model, as well as their combinations. Results show that the consideration of velocity nonlinearity in bank erosion model leads to highly upstreamskewing geometry of fully developed river meanders, as well as a slower downstream migration of meander trains. The influence of nonlinearity in bank erosion model is much smaller than the influence of bank height, which reduces the bank migration rate exponentially in the newly introduced bank erosion model. The outer bank height consideration tends to decelerate the downstream migration rate of river meanders and accelerate lateral expansion of the floodplain as well. Consequently, a broader floodplain is generated compared with simulations without bank height considerations.},

To study the influence of channel sinuousness on the flow and sediment transport, and consequently the bed morphology in meandering rivers, experiments were carried out in a series of curved channels with erodible bed fixed side walls. Measurements on the surface flow field, bed topography evolution and sediment transport rate were performed. Experimental results show a high velocity area near convex bank at a streamwise position a little bit upstream of the apex and the increasing in sinuousness of channel tends to increase the cross-sectional variation of flow velocity at the apex of bends. Point bars and pools appear in the channel bends in all experimental runs the bedform has an obvious tendency of downstream migration as a whole. The quasi-equilibrium bedform in the channel bends are dominated by two independent factors: the influence of curvature and the influence of flow-bed instability inside the channel. The increasing of flow rate leads to a faster development of bars and pools, as well as faster downstream migration of the entire bedform. The increase of sinuousness in channel bends leads to the increase of both the spatial and the temporal fluctuation of bedforms. Bedload is dominant in the sediment transport and the sediment transport rate tends to increase with the increasing of the inlet flow rate but decrease with the increasing of the channel sinuousness. Computational results on the bed topography in river bends was also presented based on empirical models, showing that the highly sinuous channels have more uncertainty in bed morphology and more difficult to be predicted with mathematical models when compared with slightly sinuous channel bends. The coupled interaction of point bars, mid-channel bars, alternative bars and even sand ripples are thought to complicate the mechanism and make the bed morphology difficult to predict. The experiment results can be useful for further theoretical study on the dynamics of river meanders with water depth-width ratio as small as 1/10 to 1/20 and bedload dominated sediment transport.},

  abstract = {Numerical groundwater flow and solute transport models are usually subject to model structural error due to simplification and/or misrepresentation of the real system, which raises questions regarding the suitability of conventional least squares regression-based (LSR) calibration. We present a new framework that explicitly describes the model structural error statistically in an inductive, data-driven way. We adopt a fully Bayesian approach that integrates Gaussian process error models into the calibration, prediction, and uncertainty analysis of groundwater flow models. We test the usefulness of the fully Bayesian approach with a synthetic case study of the impact of pumping on surface-ground water interaction. We illustrate through this example that the Bayesian parameter posterior distributions differ significantly from parameters estimated by conventional LSR, which does not account for model structural error. For the latter method, parameter compensation for model structural error leads to biased, overconfident prediction under changing pumping condition. In contrast, integrating Gaussian process error models significantly reduces predictive bias and leads to prediction intervals that are more consistent with validation data. Finally, we carry out a generalized LSR recalibration step to assimilate the Bayesian prediction while preserving mass conservation and other physical constraints, using a full error covariance matrix obtained from Bayesian results. It is found that the recalibrated model achieved lower predictive bias compared to the model calibrated using conventional LSR. The results highlight the importance of explicit treatment of model structural error especially in circumstances where subsequent decision-making and risk analysis require accurate prediction and uncertainty quantification.},

The revised universal soil loss equation and sediment delivery distribution models were used to estimate the soil erosion processes. The landscape patterns include the landscape metrics at the landscape level, landscape composition and configuration indicators on the basis of source{\textendash}sink landscape theory. In the study area, the grassland, bare land, farmland and construction land were the sediment-source landscape; the forest and shrub were the sediment-sink landscape. The correlation analysis results showed that the soil erosion processes were significantly associated with the landscape patterns of the study area. At the landscape level, fragmentation metric was positively correlated with soil erosion; diversity metric was negatively related to soil erosion and sediment yield at the sub-basin scale. Among the source{\textendash}sink landscape composition and configuration indicators, the composition indicator was positively correlated with soil erosion rate and sediment yield. In the configuration landscape indices, the shape index was negatively correlated with soil erosion rate and sediment yield; the fragmentation index was positively correlated with soil erosion rate and negatively correlated with sediment delivery rate. These results indicated that the optimization measures, such as increase in the area, connectivity and regularity of sediment-sink landscape, or decrease in the proportion, connectivity and regularity of sediment-source landscape, were favorable for soil conservation. Furthermore, the landscape indicators based on the source{\textendash}sink theory could provide more information for landscape pattern optimization to reduce soil erosion.}

The influence of aspect ratio, channel sinuousness and curvature ratio were investigated. Simulation results show that with an increasing of channel aspect ratios, the streamwise variation of flow velocities decreases significantly, which is not the case for the spanwise direction. Simulation results also reveal the significant influence of the curvature ratio on the redistribution of primary flows. The streamwise variation of free-surface and bottom-wall velocities was compared and the phase differences between them was identified, which was described as anti-phase and out-of-phase patterns. Deep-water channels with an aspect ratio of 0.15 show significant phase-lag of flow velocities compared with channel geometry, this newly observed phenomenon implies the shift of the peak scouring point in fluvial river meanders. For the first time to our knowledge, the streamwise and spanwise variation of primary and secondary flow strength, as well as their spatial derivatives, are quantitatively provided, which are valuable for theoretical studies. It is also found that the widely adopted assumption that the streamwise velocity component is one order magnitude larger than the spanwise, is only valid for river bends with small curvatures and aspect ratios.},

  abstract = {The benefits of developing the world's hydropower potential are intensely debated when considering the need to avoid or minimize environmental impacts. However, estimates of global unused profitable hydropower potential with strict environmental constraints have rarely been reported. In this study we performed a global assessment of the unused profitable hydropower potential by developing a unified framework that identifies a subset of hydropower station locations with reduced environmental impacts on the network of 2.89 million rivers worldwide. We found that the global unused profitable hydropower potential is 5.27\,PWh\,yr-1, two-thirds of which is distributed across the Himalayas. Africa's unused profitable hydropower is 0.60\,PWh\,yr-1, four times larger than its developed hydropower. By contrast, Europe's hydropower potential is extremely exploited. The estimates, derived from a consistent and transparent framework, are useful for formulating national hydropower development strategies.},

  abstract = {Estimates of the onset of sediment motion are integral for flood protection and river management but are often highly inaccurate. The critical shear stress ({$\tau$}*c) for grain entrainment is often assumed constant, but measured values can vary by almost an order of magnitude between rivers. Such variations are typically explained by differences in measurement methodology, grain size distributions, or flow hydraulics, whereas grain resistance to motion is largely assumed to be constant. We demonstrate that grain resistance varies strongly with the bed structure, which is encapsulated by the particle height above surrounding sediment (protrusion, p) and intergranular friction ({$\phi$}f). We incorporate these parameters into a novel theory that correctly predicts resisting forces estimated in the laboratory, field, and a numerical model. Our theory challenges existing models, which significantly overestimate bed mobility. In our theory, small changes in p and {$\phi$}f can induce large changes in {$\tau$}*c without needing to invoke variations in measurement methods or grain size. A data compilation also reveals that scatter in empirical values of {$\tau$}*c can be partly explained by differences in p between rivers. Therefore, spatial and temporal variations in bed structure can partly explain the deviation of {$\tau$}*c from an assumed constant value. Given that bed structure is known to vary with applied shear stresses and upstream sediment supply, we conclude that a constant {$\tau$}*c is unlikely. Values of {$\tau$}*c are not interchangeable between streams, or even through time in a given stream, because they are encoded with the channel history.},

  abstract = {Predicted bedload fluxes often have large errors partly because calculations usually do not include spatial and temporal flow variability. Sediment motion is driven by a temporal distribution of applied fluid forces, which are often simplified into time-averaged flow velocities or shear stresses in sediment transport equations. Spatial variations in these flow parameters are also often neglected. Given the nonlinearities in the relation between flow and sediment flux, the reach-averaged sediment flux calculated with an average velocity or shear stress will not necessarily equal the measured spatially averaged bedload flux. Such spatial and temporal flow variations are ignored with the commonly used reach-averaged shear stress ({$\tau$}ds) that is a function of the flow depth and channel slope. To demonstrate the uncertainties with using reach-averaged shear stresses, and even local shear stresses, to predict bedload transport rates, we have three goals. First, we outline the derivations and assumptions involved with commonly used estimates of shear stress. Second, we summarize the literature on the uncertainties involved with using shear stress, and other space- and time-averaged flow parameters, to predict sediment flux. Third, we use a new data set from experiments to add further support to a growing body of literature that suggests {$\tau$}ds may not be linked to the mechanics of bedload transport. We show considerable uncertainties exist in estimating a reach-averaged shear stress, by comparing {$\tau$}ds and near-bed shear stresses calculated from velocity profiles, Reynolds stresses, and local turbulence. For example, {$\tau$}ds was systematically greater than these near-bed stresses even for experiments without large bed roughness. We also find that correlations between local time-averaged sediment fluxes and local Reynolds stresses or turbulence intensities are relatively poor. The near-bed, time-averaged local flow velocity has the strongest relation with the time-averaged local bedload flux because it is closely related to the forces that actually drive sediment transport. However, sediment transport rates in individual experiments could still vary by orders of magnitude for a given value of this flow velocity, suggesting that additional work is needed to identity a parameter, or distributions of parameters, that will best predict sediment fluxes.},

  abstract = {The rationale behind this research concerns the need to better understand relationships between landscape pattern and soil loss processes. Landscape indicators are commonly used to delineate these relationships. However, most indicators were not developed on the basis of soil loss progresses, and therefore their specific relationships with soil loss are difficult to construct. We improved the Location-weighted landscape Contrast Index which was developed based on sediment source{\textendash}sink theory. This indicator encompasses three factors of landscape pattern: contribution of land cover types to soil erosion; composition and configuration of land covers. To analyze correlations between the landscape indicator and soil loss processes, variables expressing soil loss status should be first quantified. Therefore we applied the sediment delivery distributed model which incorporates revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and sediment delivery ratio. The methods were applied in the Heishui and Zhenjiangguan subwatershed in the Upper Min River. Modeling results showed that 90\% of the study area experienced soil erosion larger than 10t/(hayr). While its sediment yield rate was smaller than most tributaries in the Upper Yangtze River. Results of Pearson correlation analysis indicated that the rainfall factor in RUSLE was the dominant control and explained 93\% of variance in sediment yield rate. We suggested preserving and increasing percentage cover of forests to adapt to climate change for soil conservation. Besides precipitation, landscape pattern was a principle factor correlated with sediment yield rate. The landscape indicator was significantly correlated to sediment delivery ratio, and explained 98\% variation in sediment yield rate not considering precipitation by dropping the rainfall factor. The landscape indicator indicated that the landscape pattern was generally favorable for soil conservation in the two subwatersheds. This advantage was mainly ascribed to superior sediment sink{\textendash}source compositions. In the Heishui subwatershed, however, sediment source contributed more to soil erosion processes than sink. Spatial configuration of sediment source and sink related to flow length were the most unfavorable factor, mainly due to the crops located in river vallyes. We gave suggestion to further optimize the landscape pattern: reducing percentage cover of grasslands with high soil erosion rate; decreasing soil erosion rate of sediment source in the Heishui subwatershed; increasing lengths of flow path from crops to river channels.},

  abstract = {The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its main derivate, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), are widely used in estimating hillslope erosion. The effects of topography on hillslope erosion are estimated through the product of slope length (L) and slope steepness (S) subfactors, or LS factor, which often contains the highest detail and plays the most influential role in RUSLE. However, current LS maps in New South Wales (NSW) are either incomplete (e.g. point-based) or too coarse (e.g. 250 m), limiting RUSLE-based applications. The aim of this study was to develop automated procedures in a geographic information system (GIS) to estimate and map the LS factor across NSW. The method was based on RUSLE specifications and it incorporated a variable cutoff slope angle, which improves the detection of the beginning and end of each slope length. An overland-flow length algorithm for L subfactor calculation was applied through iterative slope-length cumulation and maximum downhill slope angle. Automated GIS scripts have been developed for LS factor calculation so that the only required input data are digital elevation models (DEMs). Hydrologically corrected DEMs were used for LS factor calculation on a catchment basis, then merged to form a seamless LS-factor digital map for NSW with a spatial resolution {\textasciitilde}30 m (or 1 s). The modelled LS values were compared with the reference LS values, and the coefficient of efficiency reached 0.97. The high-resolution digital LS map produced is now being used along with other RUSLE factors in hillslope erosion modelling and land-use planning at local and regional scales across NSW.},

Its inherent lack of shock-capturing capability often results in spurious oscillations and computational instabilities. However, the ADI scheme is still widely adopted in flood modelling software, and various special treatments have been designed to stabilise the computation. Modification of the Boussinesq coefficient to adjust the amount of fluid inertia is a numerical treatment that allows the ADI scheme to be applicable to rapid flows. This study comprehensively examines the impact of this numerical treatment over a range of flow conditions. A shock-capturing TVD-MacCormack model is used to provide reference results. For unsteady flows over a frictionless bed, such as idealised dam-break floods, the results suggest that an increase in the value of the Boussinesq coefficient reduces the amplitude of the spurious oscillations. The opposite is observed for steady rapid flows over a frictional bed. Finally, a two-dimensional urban flooding phenomenon is presented, involving unsteady flow over a frictional bed. The results show that increasing the value of the Boussinesq coefficient can significantly reduce the numerical oscillations and reduce the predicted area of inundation. In order to stabilise the ADI computations, the Boussinesq coefficient could be judiciously raised or lowered depending on whether the rapid flow is steady or unsteady and whether the bed is frictional or frictionless. An increase in the Boussinesq coefficient generally leads to overprediction of the propagating speed of the flood wave over a frictionless bed, but the opposite is true when bed friction is significant.},

Shields laid the foundation for this research direction, leading to the well-known Shields curve. Here we review the most widely used threshold curves that have followed from the original Shields curve over the last 80 years, and propose that in terms of physical processes the threshold (critical Shields parameter) is a function of at least six variables, i.e. grain Reynolds number, grain size distribution, sphericity, roundness, particle cohesiveness and the scale effects of turbulence. Identifying these key factors, we paid a special attention to the role of the scale effects of turbulence. Turbulence was thought to be a random process, but the improvement of measurement techniques revealed that it has both temporal and spatial structures: the magnitude of instantaneous velocity fluctuations varies in time and in location, which can cause the deviation between in situ measurements and flume experiments. In coastal and shelf waters, in situ measurements of tidal currents and suspended sediment concentrations have revealed that resuspension takes place even though the bed shear stress is well below the Shields curve. Further process and mechanism studies are required to improve the theoretical framework regarding the turbulence structures and their interplay with sediment threshold. The scientific problems for future studies include the establishment of laboratory experiments, in situ measurements and process-based modelling under different water depths and hydrodynamic conditions to quantify the scale effects of turbulence; the development of new observation techniques for higher resolution and for extreme environments; development of new data processing methods, including big data methods to analyse turbulence structures; and the quantification of the effects of biological contributions and non-particle components on the family of Shields curves.},

However, compared to the marine environment, the occurrence, transport, and diffusion of microplastics in freshwater sediment are still open questions. This paper summarizes and compares the methods used in previous studies and provides suggestions for sampling and analysis of microplastics in freshwater sediment. This paper also reviews the findings on microplastics in freshwater sediment, including abundance, morphological characteristics, polymer types, sources, and factors affecting the abundance of microplastics in freshwater sediment. The results show that microplastics are ubiquitous in the investigated sediment of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, with an abundance of 2{\textendash}5 orders of magnitude across different regions. Low microplastics concentration was observed in the Ciwalengke River with an average abundance of 30.3 {$\pm$} 15.9 items/kg. In particular, an extremely high abundance of microplastics was recorded in the urban recipient in Norway reaching 12,000{\textendash}200,000 items/kg. Fibers with particle size less than 1 mm are the dominant shape for microplastics in freshwater sediment. In addition, the most frequently recorded colors and types are white/transparent, and PE/PS, respectively. Finally, we conclude that the consistency of morphological characteristics and components of microplastics between the beach or marine sediments and freshwater sediments may be an indicator of these interlinkages and source-pathways. Microplastics in freshwater sediment need further research and exploration to identify its spatial and temporal variations and driving force through further field sampling and implementation of standard and uniform analytical methodologies.},

The distinctive microbial communities in oceanic trench sediments are expected because of the extremely high pressure and V-shape topology that caused the isolation from the other marine sediments. However, they have only been primarily targeted using `universal' primers that provide variable performances for different environments. It is necessary to design specific primers to improve the detection resolution of unique microbial groups in oceanic trenches. Here, we designed one pair of bacterial and two pairs of archaeal specific primers based on 16S rRNA gene full-length sequences that truly come from trench sediment and tested their performances in 30 oceanic trench sediment samples. An in silico analysis showed that the V3{\textendash}V4 hypervariable region was the most informative and representative for oceanic trench microbial groups. Compared with the `universal' primers, 46 bacterial families were only detected by newly designed primer B344F/B749R, and eight archaeal families were only detected by the newly designed primer A306F/A713R which covered the one or two orders of magnitude more ASVs (amplicon sequence variants) (1,470,216) in the tested total 30 samples. Moreover, A306F/A713R had the largest number of observed ASVs suggesting its better performance in discovering more archaeal species which were easily ignored in universal primer-based experiments for oceanic trench sediments. The novel primers designed in this research could be a better option to access the unique microbial communities in extreme oceanic trench sediments.},

  abstract = {In recent years, dam management guidelines need to estimate the effects of downstream flow on environment. However, high-flow alters physical conditions such as water depth, flow velocity and water temperature in the downstream side of the river. These changes will lead to alteration in fish habitat of the river. In this paper, an eco-hydraulic model was used to determine the levels of fish habitat in the Colorado River downstream from the Glen Canyon Dam. This model has been proposed by combining hydrodynamic and heat transfer model with a habitat suitability index model based on fish preference curves. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis) were chosen as target species because they represent both native and non-native fish in the study area. Flow velocity, water depth and water temperature were selected as the suitability indicators. The hydrological data from three high-flow experiments were analyzed to determine the effects of high-flow on the Colorado River ecosystem. Numerical model simulations were undertaken as follows: firstly, based on the hydrodynamic and heat transfer equation, three hydraulic factors including water depth, velocity and temperature distribution were simulated and the associated suitability for each was obtained based on the fish preference curves. Later, the habitat suitability equation was developed to simulate the target species{\dbend} habitat situation in high flow effects. Finally, the WUA (weighted usable area) and OSI (overall suitability index) of the spawning fish species were quantitatively calculated to evaluate the sensitivity of the high flow. The results show that the effects of three HFE are more severe in spawning flannelmouth sucker than in spawning rainbow trout. It is worth noting that the one day HFE was beneficial to spawning rainbow trout and harmful to spawning flannelmouth sucker but in the HFE of more than 8 days, both the spawning habitats were completely destroyed.},

Fish habitat suitability models assess habitat quality, based on abiotic parameters, namely, flow velocity, depth, and substratum data. These are all derived from a hydro-morpho-dynamic model. The relationships between parameters and habitat features are represented as suitability index curves (SI curves) or fuzzy rules. To dynamically simulate fish species, two different population models are developed. The first is converted from a logistic population concept. Its model parameters are related to time-dependent fish habitat conditions, namely, weighted usable areas and an overall suitability index. The second model is based on a matrix population concept, with numbers as the only state vector. Age-specific fecundities and survival rates depend on the habitat qualities defined in the matrix population model. The eco-hydraulic model provides very promising results, highlighting the fundamental role of temporal variability of hydro-morphological parameters in structuring habitat and populations of fish species. Using this software to anticipate water management changes, simulated population trends can help decision-makers optimize management measures.},

In this study, a 2D ecohydraulic model system was proposed and used to evaluate the habitat suitability index, weighted useable areas, overall suitability index, fish population number, and fish population density of Colorado River. The 2D ecohydraulic model system comprised hydrodynamic, hydromorphology, habitat, and population models. Three fish species were selected as target fish, which included rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brown trout (Salmo trutta), and flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis). Five computational domains of the Colorado River were selected for the ecohydraulic model. The surveyed fish data from 2000 to 2009 were used to calibrate the model system. Results indicated that the predicted fish number showed a good agreement with the surveyed fish. It is indicated that the rainbow trout and brown trout fish number showed decreasing trends from 2000 to 2009, while flannelmouth sucker showed increasing trend from 2000 to 2009. The proposed approach demonstrates that the ecohydraulic model system can be used to accurately simulate the river habitat quality and population status. The ecohydraulic model can be an efficient tool to improve understanding of the different scenarios and to assistant for multiple fish habitat and population prediction in river system. It can also provide decision-makers with valuable information to optimize their management.},

  abstract = {The development of automated (computer-based) calibration methods has focused mainly on the selection of a singleobjective measure of the distance between the model-simulated output and the data and the selection of an automatic optimization algorithm to search for the parameter values which minimize that distance. However, practical experience with model calibration suggests that no single-objective function is adequate to measure the ways in which the model fails to match the important characteristics of the observed data. Given that some of the latest hydrologic models simulate several of the watershed output fluxes (e.g. water, energy, chemical constituents, etc.), there is a need for effective and efficient multiobjective calibration procedures capable of exploiting all of the useful information about the physical system contained in the measurement data time series. The MOCOM-UA algorithm, an effective and efficient methodology for solving the multipleobjective global optimization problem, is presented in this paper. The method is an extension of the successful SCE-UA single-objective global optimization algorithm. The features and capabilities of MOCOM-UA are illustrated by means of a simple hydrologic model calibration study. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

This reach has gone through severe sediment extractions for over 50 years, leading to the construction of two weirs for riverbed stabilisation. Two large floods resulted in changes in the LDG's hydromorphological characteristics as it went from a single channel river section to a braided river reach. In this study, a 2D hydromorphological model is developed with the TELEMAC-MASCARET system to reproduce the evolution of the channel following a flood that occurred in 2018. The model's validity is assessed by comparing the simulated topographic evolution to the observed one. The results reveal the challenge of choosing well-fitted sediment transport equations and friction laws that would make it possible to reproduce such complex morphology. Even if the exact localisation of the multiple channels forming the braided nature of the LDG was challenging to reproduce, our model could provide reliable volumetric predictions as it reproduces the filling of the LDG correctly. The influence of the two weirs on the river's current and future morphology is also studied. The aim is to provide decision-makers with more reliable predictions to design suitable restoration measures for the LDG reach.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

To reduce the numerical diffusion, the second-order upwind scheme of Roe is incorporated to discretize the convection terms. The standard k-e model has been modified to take account of some anisotropic effects appearing in shallow curved channels, i.e., streamline curvature and the damping effects of free surface and solid walls. The governing equations are solved in a collocated grid system by a fractional three-step implicit algorithm. Two test cases from curved flumes have been studied: (1) A 2700 channel bend with a sloped outer bank; and (2) a meandering channel with mass transport. The results are compared with the available data, which shows generally good agreement.},

This paper reviews and evaluates the various optimization methods that have been used for solving the inverse problem of parameter identification (estimation), experimental design, and groundwater planning and management. Various model selection criteria are discussed, as well as criteria used for model discrimination. The inverse problem of parameter identification concerns the optimal determination of model parameters using water-level observations. In general, the optimal experimental design seeks to find sampling strategies for the purpose of estimating the unknown model parameters. A typical objective of optimal conjunctiveuse planning of surface water and groundwater is to minimize the operational costs of meeting water demand. The optimization methods include mathematical programming techniques such as linear programming, quadratic programming, dynamic programming, stochastic programming, nonlinear programming, and the global search algorithms such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and tabu search. Emphasis is placed on groundwater flow problems as opposed to contaminant transport problems. A typical two-dimensional groundwater flow problem is used to explain the basic formulations and algorithms that have been used to solve the formulated optimization problems.},

Five experiments, each having the same initial sediment-size gradation but a different inflow hydrograph, were done in a 1800 channel bend with a constant radius of curvature. In addition, bed elevations across various sections of the bend were measured, and bedsurface sediment were sampled at the peak and end of the hydrograph in each experiment. Experimental results indicated that the characteristics of the hydrograph have prominent influences on bed topography and transverse sediment sorting. Those cases with a higher ramping rate of the hydrograph have greater deposition heights near the inner bank and larger scour depths near the outer bank. Furthermore, the sediment is finer near the inner bank and coarser near the outer bank in cases with a higher ramping rate. The bed deformation and sediment-size variation correlated well with the unsteady-flow parameter defined in this study. Furthermore, regression relations for transverse bed profile, transverse variation of sediment size, and total amount of sediment discharge were established in terms of the unsteady-flow parameter.},

However, most land surface or Earth system models do not account for the gradual changes of reservoir surface area and storage with the changing depth, inhibiting a consistent and accurate representation of mass, energy, and biogeochemical balances in reservoirs. Here we present a physically coherent parameterization of reservoir storage-area-depth data set at the global scale. For each reservoir, the storage-area-depth relationships were derived from an optimal geometric shape selected iteratively from five possible regular geometric shapes that minimize the error of total storage and surface area estimation. We applied this algorithm to over 6,800 reservoirs included in the Global Reservoir and Dam database. The relative error between the estimated and observed total storage is no more than 5\% and 50\% for 66\% and 99\% of all Global Reservoir and Dam reservoirs, respectively. More importantly, the storage-depth profiles derived from the approximated reservoir geometry compared well with remote sensing based estimation at 40 major reservoirs from previous studies and ground-truth measurements for 34 reservoirs in the United States and China. The new global reservoir storage-area-depth data set is critical for advancing future modeling and understanding of reservoir processes and subsequent effects on the terrestrial hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical cycles at the regional and global scales.},

  abstract = {Groynes are structures constructed at an angle to the flow in order to deflect the flowing water away from critical zones. They are made of stone, gravel, rock, earth, or piles, beginning at the riverbank with a root and ending at the regulation line with a head. They serve to maintain a desirable channel for the purpose of flood control, improved navigation and erosion control. In the River Rhine, which is considered the backbone of North-western European waterways network, the primary objective of groynes is to provide a fairway of sufficient depth and width. For example the River Waal, the most important branch of the Rhine River in the Netherlands is regulated by around 500 groyne. Within the framework of the research project \&quot;Space for the Rhine Branches\&quot; several measures have been devised to achieve a decrease of the water levels at peak discharges, one of those measures, is lowering of the existing groynes. The rationale behind this proposal is that; due to large-scale erosion of the low-water bed through the past decades, the groynes are now higher than necessary for keeping the main channel at depth. Lowering the groynes along certain reaches of the river would result in a reduction of the effective roughness during high water conditions thus, increasing the river's flood conveyance capacity. If the groynes are lowered, however, the balance of hydrodynamic forces acting on the groyne-fields will change, and there will be a large-scale morphological impact. To identify this impact, a thorough understanding to the effect o f groynes on the morphology of the river is necessary. The sediment exchange between the groyne-fields and the main channel needs to be more comprehensible. The purpose of this report is to acquire the background knowledge required to study the effect of groynes on a river. The characteristics of the existing groyne-fields along the Waal River are presented. The hydrodynamic and morphological impact of groynes on a river is described. Moreover, because navigation plays an important role in the interaction between the groyne fields and the main channel, the navigation induced water motion and its effect on the flow in groyne-fields is described. Finally, a review of some prediction attempts to the interaction between the groyne-fields and the main channel is presented.},

For rivers, two-dimensional hydrodynamic models are considered essential for a wide range of questions. Every five years, there is a major model revision that includes software updates, improved physical processes, new modelling strategy, and a new calibration. 2017 marked the setup and calibration of the first river model in the sixth generation of these models. In this paper, we discuss the most recent developments in twodimensional hydrodynamic modelling of rivers. We give an overview of the process followed to agree on the functional design of the model and address the use of the recently developed Delft3D Flexible Mesh suite. We address, in some details: i) a mesh independent approach for model setup; ii) the utilisation of a new calibration technique, which is automated using data assimilation and includes spatial and discharge dependencies; and iii) the use of a novel operational module to control hydraulic structures. The first river model within the 6th generation of models is that of the Meuse River, where the new approaches are being successfully applied. In conclusion: the mesh independent modelling approach offers great flexibility and facilitates that the same data set can be used for multiple versions of the model (e.g. different grid resolution; or different model extent). The automated calibration approach makes it possible to utilise a comprehensive calibration data set for a large-scale model in a reproducible way. The increased complexity of modelling has become possible over the last decade due to the availability of large datasets and increased computational power. This paper is particularly relevant for modellers and decision makers alike.},

  abstract = {Learning rate decay (lrDecay) is a {\textbackslash}emph\{de facto\} technique for training modern neural networks. It starts with a large learning rate and then decays it multiple times. It is empirically observed to help both optimization and generalization. Common beliefs in how lrDecay works come from the optimization analysis of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent: 1) an initially large learning rate accelerates training or helps the network escape spurious local minima; 2) decaying the learning rate helps the network converge to a local minimum and avoid oscillation. Despite the popularity of these common beliefs, experiments suggest that they are insufficient in explaining the general effectiveness of lrDecay in training modern neural networks that are deep, wide, and nonconvex. We provide another novel explanation: an initially large learning rate suppresses the network from memorizing noisy data while decaying the learning rate improves the learning of complex patterns. The proposed explanation is validated on a carefully-constructed dataset with tractable pattern complexity. And its implication, that additional patterns learned in later stages of lrDecay are more complex and thus less transferable, is justified in real-world datasets. We believe that this alternative explanation will shed light into the design of better training strategies for modern neural networks.},

Despite the results of initial research studies that report ML algorithm diagnostic accuracy similar to or exceeding that of radiologists, the results are less impressive when the algorithms are installed at new hospitals and are presented with new images. This phenomenon is potentially the result of selection bias in the data that were used to develop the ML algorithm. Selection bias has long been described by clinical epidemiologists as a key consideration when designing a clinical research study, but this concept has largely been unaddressed in the medical imaging ML literature. The authors discuss the importance of selection bias and its relevance to ML algorithm development to prepare the radiologist to critically evaluate ML literature for potential selection bias and understand how it might affect the applicability of ML algorithms in real clinical environments. {\textcopyright}RSNA, 2020}

Firstly, information granulation in a FPIS is proposed. Then, information entropy and rough entropy in a FPIS are proposed. Moreover, information amount in a FPIS is also investigated. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed measures are verified by a numerical example, and the statistical analysis is carried out. Those obtained results may be useful for understanding the essence of uncertainty for a FPIS.},

Searching for the optimal inversion solutions is similar to the social behavior observed in swarms such as birds and ants when searching for food. In this article, first the particle swarm optimization algorithm was described in detail, and ant colony algorithm improved. Then the methods were applied to three different kinds of geophysical inversion problems: (1) a linear problem which is sensitive to noise, (2) a synchronous inversion of linear and nonlinear problems, and (3) a nonlinear problem. The results validate their feasibility and efficiency. Compared with the conventional genetic algorithm and simulated annealing, they have the advantages of higher convergence speed and accuracy. Compared with the quasi-Newton method and LevenbergMarquardt method, they work better with the ability to overcome the locally optimal solutions.},

Because of the numerous advantages of numerical modeling, effects of different geometries of reservoirs on the flow pattern and deposition of sediments are investigated using the finite volume based Flow-3D software package. In this study, three rectangular reservoirs with different dimensional ratios are simulated using the large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence model. To validate the numerical modeling, existing experimental data is used. Results indicate that Flow-3D can accurately simulate flow and sediment deposition in the reservoirs, and the numerical data are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results. Numerical efforts showed that the amount of deposition in reservoirs is significantly dependent on the geometry. Among the modeled reservoirs, the 6 {\texttimes} 4 m one has the best performance. Moreover, it can be said that changing the position of the flow's inlet and outlet of the reservoir does not have a considerable effect on increasing its efficiency.},

  abstract = {This work presents and illustrates the application of hydroPSO, a novel multi-OS and model-independent R package used for model calibration. hydroPSO allows the modeller to perform a standard modelling work flow including, sensitivity analysis, parameter calibration, and assessment of the calibration results, using a single piece of software. hydroPSO implements several state-of-the-art enhancements and fine-tuning options to the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm to meet specific user needs. hydroPSO easily interfaces the calibration engine to different model codes through simple ASCII files and/or R wrapper functions for exchanging information on the calibration parameters. Then, optimises a userdefined goodness-of-fit measure until a maximum number of iterations or a convergence criterion are met. Finally, advanced plotting functionalities facilitate the interpretation and assessment of the calibration results. The current hydroPSO version allows easy parallelization and works with single-objective functions, with multi-objective functionalities being the subject of ongoing development. We compare hydroPSO against standard algorithms (SCE\_UA, DE, DREAM, SPSO-2011, and GML) using a series of benchmark functions. We further illustrate the application of hydroPSO in two real-world case studies: we calibrate, first, a hydrological model for the Ega River Basin (Spain) and, second, a groundwater flow model for the Pampa del Tamarugal Aquifer (Chile). Results from the comparison exercise indicate that hydroPSO is: i) effective and efficient compared to commonly used optimisation algorithms, ii) ``scalable'', i.e. maintains a high performance for increased problem dimensionality, and iii) versatile to adapt to different response surfaces of the objective function. Case study results highlight the functionality and ease of use of hydroPSO to handle several issues that are commonly faced by the modelling community such as: working on different operating systems, single or batch model execution, transient- or steady-state modelling conditions, and the use of alternative goodness-of-fit measures to drive parameter optimisation. Although we limit the application of hydroPSO to hydrological models, flexibility of the package suggests it can be implemented in a wider range of models requiring some form of parameter optimisation.},

Recent advances in the field of stable isotope ecology allow the estimation of food chain length (FCL) from stable nitrogen isotope ({$\delta$}15N) data. We conducted a global literature synthesis and estimated FCL for 219 lake, stream, and marine ecosystems. Streams had shorter food chains ({$\sim$}3.5 trophic levels) than marine and lake ecosystems ({$\sim$}4.0 trophic levels). In marine systems, inclusion of marine mammals increased FCL by 2/3 of a trophic level. For each ecosystem type, estimates of FCL were normally distributed and spanned two full trophic levels. Comparison with published connectance food webs revealed similar mean FCL values, though stable isotope-derived FCL estimates were less variable. At the global scale, FCL showed weak or no relationships with ecosystem size, mean annual air temperature, or latitude. Our study highlights the utility of stable isotopes for quantifying among-system food web variability, and the application of this approach for assessing global-scale patterns of food chain length.},

In response to this need, major new initiatives in hydropower development are now under way. At least 3,700 major dams, each with a capacity of more than 1~MW, are either planned or under construction, primarily in countries with emerging economies. These dams are predicted to increase the present global hydroelectricity capacity by 73~\% to about 1,700 GW. Even such a dramatic expansion in hydropower capacity will be insufficient to compensate for the increasing electricity demand. Furthermore, it will only partially close the electricity gap, may not substantially reduce greenhouse gas emission (carbon dioxide and methane), and may not erase interdependencies and social conflicts. At the same time, it is certain to reduce the number of our planet's remaining free-flowing large rivers by about 21~\%. Clearly, there is an urgent need to evaluate and to mitigate the social, economic, and ecological ramifications of the current boom in global dam construction.},

Hydropower development will disproportionately impact areas of high freshwater megafauna richness in South America, South and East Asia, and the Balkan region. Sub-catchments with a high share of threatened species are considered to be most vulnerable; these are located in Central America, Southeast Asia and in the regions of the Black and Caspian Sea. Based on this approach, planned dam locations are classified according to their potential impact on freshwater megafauna species at different spatial scales, attention to potential conflicts between climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation are highlighted, and priorities for freshwater management are recommended.},

It is also shown that in predicting the water surface profile with a very distorted mesh, most of the errors arise from the large aspect ratio rather than the skewness of the grid lines. The model is then applied to three meandering channels ͑two simple and one compound͒, with specifications similar to those found in nature and the results are compared with experimental data.

  abstract = {In January 1990 10 m3 of washed gravel (grain size 16{\textendash}50 mm) were introduced in an impounded section of the River High-Rhine to test its potential as a spawning ground for salmonids. The process of infiltration of fine sediments into the gravel and subsequent clogging was monitored for three years. Levels of clogging of the gravel matrix were estimated and ranged from slight to moderately-heavy. The degree of clogging was lower in winter than in summer. Since no bedload transport was observed during the study period, flood events could wash out sediments from the top layer of the gravel bed only. An equilibrium diffusion technique using porewater samplers was employed to measure oxygen concentrations within the interstitial space during the spawning period ofThymallus thymallus (April),Salmo trutta fario andOncorhynchus mykiss (December till February). Oxygen concentration decreased with increasing depth and during the course of the study period. Oxygen concentrations measured as a reference in the interstitial of the confluence of the river Glatt were considerably lower than those of the new gravel bed. A wide range of O2 concentrations was found in winter 1991/92 and in spring 1992. This could be explained by the heterogeneous microstructure of the substrate. Successful embryonic and larval development of grayling in the gravel bed was observed in spring 1991 and 1992. However, no eggs or larvae of brown trout or rainbow trout were found. Habitat restoration projects for salmonids in impoundments of the High-Rhine are critically discussed.},

The nature of electric power transmission networks makes it hard to manage. Thus, giving need for optimization. So the problem of optimization of electric power transmission as considered in this paper is improving the performance and reliability of the electricity pylon; the objective is to maximize resistance to load while reducing material usage and cost. For this purpose, we suggest a new version of PSO algorithm that allows the amelioration of its performance by introducing its parallelization associated to the concept of evolutionary neighborhoods. According to the experimental results, the proposed method is effective and outperforms basic PSO in terms of solution quality, accuracy, constraint handling, and time consuming.},

The non-hydrostatic model solves the three-dimensional (3D) incompressible, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations in generalized curvilinear coordinates and integrates the equations up to the wall such that the use of wall-functions is avoided. The low-Reynolds-number version of the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) model and the k-{$\omega$} model are implemented. The k-{$\omega$} has the capability to account for the small-scale bed roughness distribution via the wall boundary condition for {$\omega$}. The model uses adaptive grids in the vertical direction needed to account for changes in the free surface elevation and bathymetry. At the free surface the proper kinematic and dynamic conditions are satisfied at convergence. A non-equilibrium bed load sediment transport model similar to the one used in Wu et. al [10] is used with the additional introduction of down-slope gravitational force effects. The model is used to predict flow through meandering open channels for which detailed validation data are available. One of the experimental cases studied by Yen [11] is used to validate the deformable free surface module and the experiments by Odgaard and Bergs [6] are used to validate the bed load transport module by predicting the flow and bed bathymetry at equilibrium.},

Additionally, a bed load transport module based on Engelund and Hansen (1967) total bed load formula is implemented and tested. In the experiment, the bed load was observed to be dominant, so the suspended sediment component is considered negligible in the simulations. The streamwise variation of the relative water depths at several representative sections are compared with the experimental data. It is found that the best agreement is obtained when the total load (which in the test case considered is equal to the bed load) is estimated using Engelund and Hansen formula with both k- and Spalart-Allmaras models. The k- predictions, using the originally implemented non-equilibrium bed load transport model based on van Rijn (1987) and Wu et al.

The main reason for the underperformance of the van Rijn model is its inability to predict the experimentally measured bed load in the initial straight part of the channel.},

The inference of hydrologists in the manual calibration was adopted as the guideline. A slight modi{\textregistered}cation of the model structure of the soil routine was suggested to avoid interdependence of the parameters. In total nine parameters, except the snow routine, Fc and MAXBAS, were calibrated automatically in two stages; {\textregistered}rst the soil moisture routine and then the others. There are six sets in two stages in total. Using the Powell method, the parameters in each step were calibrated simultaneously with carefully selected objective functions, and in particular a powerful objective function for the soil moisture routine. The steps were in a {\textregistered}xed order in the ACSH according to the model structure. The optimal values of the model parameters were stable, with the dierent initial values varying in considerable ranges. The automatic calibration gave the same model performance as the manual calibration when the ACSH was tested in two basins. The automatic calibration can thus be used as a reference or as an alternative solution of the model. \# 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Comparing and evaluating the efficacy of different optimization algorithms for calibrating computationally intensive hydrologic models is becoming a nontrivial issue. In this study, five global optimization algorithms (genetic algorithms, shuffled complex evolution, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, and artificial immune system) were tested for automatic parameter calibration of a complex hydrologic model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), in four watersheds. The results show that genetic algorithms (GA) outperform the other four algorithms given model evaluation numbers larger than 2000, while particle swarm optimization (PSO) can obtain better parameter solutions than other algorithms given fewer number of model runs (less than 2000). Given limited computational time, the PSO algorithm is preferred, while GA should be chosen given plenty of computational resources. When applying GA and PSO for parameter optimization of SWAT, small population size should be chosen. Copyright  2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Simulation-based optimization methods have been recently proposed for calibrating geotechnical models from laboratory and field tests. In these methods, geotechnical parameters are identified by matching model predictions to experimental data, i.e. by minimizing an objective function that measures the difference between the two. Expensive computational models, such as finite difference or finite element models are often required to simulate laboratory or field geotechnical tests. In such cases, simulationbased optimization might prove demanding since every evaluation of the objective function requires a new model simulation until the optimum set of parameter values is achieved. This paper introduces a novel simulation-based ``hybrid moving boundary particle swarm optimization'' (hmPSO) algorithm that enables calibration of geotechnical models from laboratory or field data. The hmPSO has proven effective in searching for model parameter values and, unlike other optimization methods, does not require information about the gradient of the objective function. Serial and parallel implementations of hmPSO have been validated in this work against a number of benchmarks, including numerical tests, and a challenging geotechnical problem consisting of the calibration of a water infiltration model for unsaturated soils. The latter application demonstrates the potential of hmPSO for interpreting laboratory and field tests as well as a tool for general back-analysis of geotechnical case studies.},

  abstract = {The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and revised USLE (RUSLE) are often used to estimate soil erosion at regional landscape scales, however a major limitation is the difficulty in extracting the LS factor. The geographic information system-based (GIS-based) methods which have been developed for estimating the LS factor for USLE and RUSLE also have limitations. The unit contributing area-based estimation method (UCA) converts slope length to unit contributing area for considering two-dimensional topography, however is not able to predict the different zones of soil erosion and deposition. The flowpath and cumulative cell length-based method (FCL) overcomes this disadvantage but does not consider channel networks and flow convergence in two-dimensional topography. The purpose of this research was to overcome these limitations and extend the FCL method through inclusion of channel networks and convergence flow. We developed LS-TOOL in Microsoft's.NET environment using C{$\sharp$} with a user-friendly interface. Comparing the LS factor calculated with the three methodologies (UCA, FCL and LS-TOOL), LS-TOOL delivers encouraging results. In particular, LS-TOOL uses breaks in slope identified from the DEM to locate soil erosion and deposition zones, channel networks and convergence flow areas. Comparing slope length and LS factor values generated using LS-TOOL with manual methods, LS-TOOL corresponds more closely with the reality of the Xiannangou catchment than results using UCA or FCL. The LS-TOOL algorithm can automatically calculate slope length, slope steepness, L factor, S factor, and LS factors, providing the results as ASCII files which can be easily used in some GIS software. This study is an important step forward in conducting more accurate large area erosion evaluation.},

The vertical bed sorting and armouring processes are simulated by introducing a layering scheme for static grains in the bed. The numerical model is applied to predict the bed deformation around a spur dyke in a uniform and a non-uniform sediment beds. It is found that both the predicted local scour geometry and the grain size distribution are reasonably consistent with those of the experiments. According to the results, local scour in a non-uniform bed is smaller than that in a uniform one. The non-uniform bed around the spur dyke is coarsened, but sand ribbons occur in the upper part of the scour hole and at the downstream of the spur dyke.},

  abstract = {The critical condition of incipient motion of cohesive sediments was investigated in a laboratory study. One-hundred experimental runs were performed with sediment samples by varying the yield stress to determine the relationship between the critical condition of incipient motion and the rheological properties of the cohesive sediments. The results indicate that yield stress is a factor that has a major influence on the incipient motion of cohesive sediments. In addition, the critical Shields parameter is found to be exponentially proportional to the yield stress and inversely proportional to the median grain size. The effect of yield stress on the critical Shields parameter is significant for the cohesive sediments and becomes progressively weaker with increasing median grain size. Furthermore, an empirical formula for calculating the critical Shields parameter of cohesive sediments that includes a rheological term and a gravity term is proposed by introducing the yield stress. According to this formula, a modified Shields diagram is obtained in which the values of the critical Shields parameter for cohesive sediments vary within a band that contains countless curves (instead of on a single line) to reflect the influence of the yield stress. This modification of the traditional Shields curve is effective for fine sediments, but the effects tend to vanish for coarse sediments as the behavior of sediments changes from cohesive to noncohesive. Finally, potential further investigations are discussed.},

USLE/RUSLE contain parameters for slope length factor (L) and slope steepness factor (S), usually combined as LS. However a major limitation is the difficulty in extracting the LS factor. Methods to estimate LS based on geographic information systems have been developed in the last two decades. L can be calculated for large watersheds using the unit contributing area (UCA) or the slope length ({$\lambda$}) as input parameters. Due to the absence of an estimation of slope length, the UCA method is insufficiently accurate. Improvement of the spatial accuracy of slope length and LS factor is still necessary for estimating soil erosion. The purpose of this study was to develop an improved method to estimate the slope length and LS factor. We combined the algorithm for multiple-flow direction (MFD) used in the UCA method with the LS-TOOL (LSTOOLSFD) algorithms, taking into account the calculation errors and cutoff conditions for distance, to obtain slope length ({$\lambda$}) and the LS factor. The new method, LS-TOOLMFD, was applied and validated in a catchment with complexly variable slopes. The slope length and LS calculated by LS-TOOLMFD both agreed better with field data than with the calculations using the LS-TOOLSFD and UCA methods, respectively. We then integrated the LSTOOLMFD algorithm into LS-TOOL developed in Microsoft's .NET environment using C\# with a user-friendly interface. The method can automatically calculate slope length, slope steepness, L, S, and LS factor, providing the results as ASCII files that can be easily used in GIS software and erosion models.

The water level, water temperature, pH and Cl- concentration in the hyporheic zone and groundwater were monitored in situ.

The results show that the water level changes of hyporheic zone and the movement of hyporheic flow were influenced significantly by the permeability coefficient of sediment. The hyporheic flow approximately 10 cm from the stream bank was clearly affected by precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration. During the study period, the groundwater recharged the stream, and the impact of groundwater on the hyporheic flow gradually decreased with the flow path. The hyporheic flow approximately 30 cm from the stream bank was still mainly affected by groundwater. Approximately 10{\textendash}30 cm from the stream bank, the mixing of groundwater with precipitation and stream water intensified. Due to the sediment properties, moisture accumulated approximately 10 cm from the stream bank and drained into the stream via hyporheic flow, with potential impacts on stream water quality.},

Thus, the standard k-{$\epsilon$} turbulence model with two equations of state is applied to study the effect of adding a water-separating curtain in the stratified reservoir on the Discharged Water Temperature (DWT). It is found that adding the Water-Separating Curtain (WSC) can effectively increase the discharged water temperature. Moreover, the different arrangements of WSC have obvious effects on the discharged water temperature. For example, the increased temperature by adding a WSC with full sealing is 1{\textcelsius} higher than that by using the WSC with a bottom opening height of 2 m. However, the maximum pressure difference acting on the WSC for the former WSC is 100 Pa higher than that for the latter WSC. In addition, this study shows that the different equations of state have little effect on the simulation results. Considering the calculation efficiency, equations of state using the Boussinesq approximation can be recommended to save the calculation time.},

  abstract = {Study region Tarago Reservoir, Victoria, Australia. Study focus This study investigates the influence of rainfall, river inflow and wind on the temperature stratification of the Tarago Reservoir by incorporating atmospheric and bathymetric conditions using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. New hydrological insights for this region In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic model was developed and applied to the Tarago Reservoir. The model allowed 3D visualization of the thermal structure, and the seasonal and longitudinal differences in stratification could be quantified using the Schmidt stability index. The simulation results revealed longitudinal differences in thermal structure among the riverine, transition, and lacustrine zones. The bathymetry affects the lake stratification and stability; furthermore, the strong vertical current caused by the sharp bathymetry gradient significantly weakens the stability in deep zones. In addition, this study assessed the impacts of rainfall and wind on lake stability using sensitivity analysis. The results indicated that rainfall decreases the water temperature of the lake but hardly affects the summer stratification. Moreover, the wind not only influences the intensity and duration of stratification but also contributes to the heat storage of waterbodies. The patterns of water current velocities and temperature also showed that the circulation generated by overflow and underflow plumes have a crucial effect on the thermal structure of the transition and lacustrine zones.},

  abstract = {Step-pool systems are common bedforms in mountain streams and have been utilized in river restoration projects around the world. Step-pool units exhibit highly nonuniform hydraulic characteristics which have been reported to closely interact with the morphological evolution and stability of step-pool features. However, detailed information on the three-dimensional hydraulics for step-pool morphology has been scarce due to the difficulty of measurement. To fill in this knowledge gap, we established a combined approach based on the technologies of structure from motion (SfM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). 3D reconstructions of bed surfaces with an artificial step-pool unit built from natural stones at six flow rates were imported to CFD simulations. The combined approach succeeded in visualizing the high-resolution 3D flow structures for the step-pool unit. The results illustrate the segmentation of flow velocity downstream of the step, i.e., the integral recirculation cell at the water surface, streamwise vortices formed at the step toe, and high-speed flow in between. The highly nonuniform distribution of turbulence energy in the pool has been revealed, and two energy dissipaters of comparable magnitude are found to co-exist in the pool. Pool scour development during flow increase leads to the expansion of recirculation cells in the pool, but this expansion stops for the cell near the water surface when flow approaches the critical value for step-pool failure. The micro-bedforms (grain clusters) developed on the negative slope affect the local hydraulics significantly, but this influence is suppressed at the pool bottom. The drag forces on the step stones increase with discharge (before the highest flow value is reached). In comparison, the lift force consistently has a larger magnitude and a more widely varying range. Our results highlight the feasibility and great potential of the approach combining physical and numerical modeling in investigating the complex flow characteristics of step-pool morphology.},

Considerable studies have investigated spatial-temporal variation of sediment load within the Loess Plateau; however, contradictory findings exist among methods used. This study systematically reviewed six quantitative methods: simple linear regression, double mass curve, sediment identity factor analysis, dam-sedimentation based method, the Sediment Delivery Distributed (SEDD) model, and the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The calculation procedures and merits for each method were systematically explained. A case study in the Huangfuchuan watershed on the northern Loess Plateau has been undertaken. The results showed that sediment load had been reduced by 70.5\% during the changing period from 1990 to 2012 compared to that of the baseline period from 1955 to 1989. Human activities accounted for an average of 93.6\,{$\pm$}\,4.1\% of the total decline in sediment load, whereas climate change contributed 6.4\,{$\pm$}\,4.1\%. Five methods produced similar estimates, but the linear regression yielded relatively different results. The results of this study provide a good reference for assessing the effects of climate change and human activities on sediment load variation by using different methods.},

Laboratory experiments examined the influence of stem diameter and arrangement on bedload sediment transport by considering arrays of different stem diameter and mixed diameters. Bedload transport rate was observed to depend on turbulent kinetic energy, with no dependence on stem diameter, which was shown to be consistent with the impulse model for sediment entrainment. Existing predictors of bedload transport for bare beds, based on bed shear stress, were recast in terms of turbulence. The new turbulence-based model predicted sediment transport measured in model canopies across a range of conditions drawn from several previous studies. A prediction of turbulence based on biomass and velocity was also described, providing an important step toward predicting turbulence and bedload transport in canopies of real vegetation morphology.},

  abstract = {An adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) that features better search efficiency than classical particle swarm optimization (PSO) is presented. More importantly, it can perform a global search over the entire search space with faster convergence speed. The APSO consists of two main steps. First, by evaluating the population distribution and particle fitness, a real-time evolutionary state estimation procedure is performed to identify one of the following four defined evolutionary states, including exploration, exploitation, convergence, and jumping out in each generation. It enables the automatic control of inertia weight, acceleration coefficients, and other algorithmic parameters at run time to improve the search efficiency and convergence speed. Then, an elitist learning strategy is performed when the evolutionary state is classified as convergence state. The strategy will act on the globally best particle to jump out of the likely local optima. The APSO has comprehensively been evaluated on 12 unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. The effects of parameter adaptation and elitist learning will be studied. Results show that APSO substantially enhances the performance of the PSO paradigm in terms of convergence speed, global optimality, solution accuracy, and algorithm reliability. As APSO introduces two new parameters to the PSO paradigm only, it does not introduce an additional design or implementation complexity.},

Understanding and modeling of the erosion process are important for many issues such as the breaching of embankments, riverbank stability, siltation of harbors and navigation channels, service life of reservoirs, distribution of (heavy metal) pollutants and water quality problems. In the last few decades, numerous studies have been done on the erosion of cohesive sediment by flow. Nevertheless, the factors affecting the erosion resistance of cohesive sediment are still not fully understood and the knowledge of the physics of cohesive sediment erosion is inadequate, as a result the mathematical modeling of this erosion is far from satisfactory. In this paper an overview of the studies on the erosion resistance, erosion threshold and the erosion rate of cohesive sediment by flow is presented. The outcomes achieved so far from the studies and the existing problems have been analyzed and summarized, based on which recommendations are proposed for future research.},

  abstract = {The prediction of the erosion of mudflats is hampered by inaccurate estimates of the erodibility distribution of the sediment bed. To investigate how erodibility varies in space and what the vertical distribution over the sediment depth is, comprehensive observations of the sediment properties, hydrodynamics and bed-level changes were conducted on an intertidal flat in the Western Scheldt Estuary, the Netherlands. The erosion potential on a mudflat is determined by the critical shear stress for erosion ( e), erosion rate coefficient (M) and local hydrodynamic conditions. A clear difference in hydrodynamic forcing was observed, leading to significant bed level variations at the low water line, where erosion often occurs during very shallow water condition, and a nearly constant bed level at the upper part. The erosion parameters e and M could be determined over a sediment bed of 12 cm at the low water line. The erosion coefficient M can be considered constant with depth, although there is a large spreading. A clear vertical variation of e was found: e increased significantly downward from 0.10 Pa at the sediment surface to 1.13 Pa at 12 cm below the surface. Additionally, there was a strong indication that the presence of diatoms enhanced e in the upper 2 mm of sediment by five times of the abiotic e (from 0.09 Pa to 0.46 Pa). These findings lead to the following improvement for predicting morphological changes of tidal mudflats: (1) very shallow conditions should be better simulated, (2) the vertical distribution of e should be considered. Otherwise, erosion rates can be overestimated, especially during extreme events, because exposure of the deeper well-consolidated layer likely occurs; and (3) an appropriate description of the effect of diatoms should be considered as part of the bottom boundary condition.},

  abstract = {The increase in minimum flows has rarely been considered to mitigate the ecological impact of hydroelectric power plants because it requires a site-specific design and expensive long-term monitoring procedure to identify the most beneficial scenario. This study presents a model-based method to estimate, within the model constraints, the most sustainable scenario of water resource sharing between nature and human needs. We studied physical habitat suitability of the Isar River in Munich (Germany) for three protected fish species: Thymallus thymallus L., Hucho hucho L., and Chondostroma nasus L. The analysis combined a high-resolution two-dimensional (2D) hydromorphological model with expert-based procedures using Computer Aided Simulation Model for Instream Flow Requirements (CASiMIR). We simulated a range of minimum discharges from 5 to 68.5 m{$^3$}/s and four scenarios: (A) maximum use of the resource for humans; (B) slight increase in the minimum water flow; (C) medium increase in the minimum water flow; and, (D) without diversion for hydroelectric production. Under the current hydromorphological conditions, model outputs showed that different life stages of the fish species showed preferences for different scenarios, and that none of the four scenarios provided permanently suitable habitat conditions for the three species. We suggest that discharge management should be combined with hydromorphological restoration actions to re-establish parts of the modified channel slope and/or parts of the previously lost floodplain habitat in order to implement a solution that favors all species at the same time. The modeling procedure that is presented may be helpful to identify the discharge scenario that is most efficient for maintaining target fish species under realistic usage conditions.},

  abstract = {Urban rivers are socioecological systems, and restored habitats may be attractive to both sensitive species and recreationists. Understanding the potential conflicts between ecological and recreational values is a critical issue for the development of a sustainable river-management plan. Habitat models are very promising tools for the ecological evaluation of river restoration projects that are already concluded, ongoing, or even to be planned. With our paper, we make a first attempt at integrating recreational user pressure into habitat modeling. The objective of this study was to analyze whether human impact is likely to hinder the re-establishment of a target species despite the successful restoration of physical habitat structures in the case of the restoration of the Isar River in Munich (Germany) and the target fish species Chondostroma nasus L. Our analysis combined high-resolution 2D hydrodynamic modeling with mapping of recreational pressure and used an expert-based procedure for modeling habitat suitability. The results are twofold: (1) the restored river contains suitable physical habitats for population conservation but has low suitability for recruitment; (2) densely used areas match highly suitable habitats for C. nasus. In the future, the integrated modeling procedure presented here may allow ecological refuge for sensitive target species to be included in the design of restoration and may help in the development of visitor-management plans to safeguard biodiversity and recreational ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Reliable assessment of the groundwater safety in coastal aquifers is efficiently supported by the use of reasonable conceptual groundwater models, which take into consideration the density driven flow and are sufficiently calibrated. A main issue in establishing the model of the aquifer studied here, in which the groundwater level exhibits significant fluctuations within the year, is the estimation of the temporal variation of the time depended input data, i.e. the groundwater recharge from the river crossing the aquifer, the precipitation, the boundary inflows and the groundwater extractions. To address this problem we estimated initial distributions for the aforementioned components of the groundwater budget from related hydrological and operational data, as it is the river recharge, the precipitation height, the base flow from neighboring formations and the operational time schedule of pumping wells, and then we defined multiplicative coefficients that scale the initial distributions to the temporal variation of the corresponding input. For the simulations, the software SEAWAT for density driven flow is used. The calibration is performed in two steps, i.e. a manual and an automatic one performed by using the code PEST combined with SEAWAT. The manual calibration has been used for adjusting the conceptual model and estimating reasonable initial values for the automatic calibration. The groundwater safety is assessed by estimating the temporal variation of the saltwater intrusion and by defining the capture zones of the exploitation wells using the code MODPATH. The study gives insight into the sequence of the assumptions required to tackle the lack of data.},

  abstract = {Gravity currents are density-driven flows that are able to transport high amounts of sediment and are responsible of great geomorphic changes. Moreover they can have severe repercussions on the environment since they are conveyors of substances, e.g. pollutants, for longdistances depending on their flow dynamics. The latter are determined by the release conditions and by the exchange at the upper and lower boundaries. The aim of this research study is to characterize the turbulent structure of gravity currents, as a consequence of the initialrelease conditions, to relate with their transport capacity.For this purpose, saline gravity currents are experimentally created in a laboratory channel through the lock-exchange technique. Different initial conditions, representing different configurations that can be found in reality, are considered during the experiments. The testedparameters are: initial buoyancy of the current in the lock, initial volume of release (i.e. lock-length), lock slope and grain sizes of the sediment that form an erodible bed over which the current flows.High-resolution velocity measurements, performed with an Acoustic Doppler Velocity Profiler (ADVP), allowed to describe both horizontal and vertical structures of the gravity currents. A universal criterion is established to isolate head and body of the current which are characterizedby different dynamics and their extensions vary in relation with the conditions of release. A new parametrization, based on the computed temporal evolution of shear stress, allows to quantify water entrainment from the upper interface and sediment erosion capacity at the bottom.The effect of the increment of gravitational forces on its erosion capacity is tested by introducing a slope in the lock reach. The range of considered slopes goes from horizontal to S=8\%. This latter is identified as a transient case in which two mechanisms compete i.e. on one side, the current entrains more water from the upper interface due to the increment of friction, the current expands, dilutes and therefore slows down; on the other side, the head is fed by the faster rear steady current thus inducing an acceleration.At the bottom, high shear stress associated with intense ejection and burst events influence erosion and bed load transport. The coupling of hydrodynamic mechanisms and processes of erosion, transport and deposition of sediment are investigated. It is shown that the upwardmotion, caused by mean and turbulent velocity components, promote vertical mixing of sediment fromthe channel bed. The feedback between the hydrodynamics of a gravity current and the geomorphic changes of a mobile bed are analysed. The shape of the front changes dueto sediment entrainment and the deposition of sediment downstream creates characteristic patterns whose geometry reflect the coherent turbulent structure of the current.The scientific contributions elaborated in this research project allow to ameliorate the modelling of these flows, describing their inherent complex mechanisms under various initiation conditions and the interaction with suspended material. This helps to formulate adaptedmitigation measures for the retention of these phenomena which frequently have a negative effect and e.g. induce reservoir sedimentation, subaqueous structure damages and scour processes in the vicinity of submerged pipelines or exacerbate pollutants dispersion},

  abstract = {Soil erosion and sediment transport have been modeled at several spatial and temporal scales, yet few models have been reported for large river basins (e.g., drainage areas {$>$} 100 000 km2). In this study, we propose a process-based distributed model for assessment of sediment transport at a large basin scale. A distributed hydrological model was coupled with a process-based distributed sediment transport model describing soil erosion and sedimentary processes at hillslope units and channels. The model was tested on two large river basins: the Chao Phraya River Basin (drainage area: 160 000 km2) and the Mekong River Basin (795 000 km2). The simulation over 10 years showed good agreement with the observed suspended sediment load in both basins. The average Nash{\textendash}Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and average correlation coefficient (r) between the simulated and observed suspended sediment loads were 0.62 and 0.61, respectively, in the Chao Phraya River Basin except the lowland section. In the Mekong River Basin, the overall average NSE and r were 0.60 and 0.78, respectively. Sensitivity analysis indicated that suspended sediment load is sensitive to detachability by raindrop (k) in the Chao Phraya River Basin and to soil detachability over land (Kf) in the Mekong River Basin. Overall, the results suggest that the present model can be used to understand and simulate erosion and sediment transport in large river basins.}
