\section{Types of something}
\label{sec:typesome}

Do \citeA{kundu2008fluid} talk about Lagrangian and Eulerian concepts visualized in \autoref{fig:example}?

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
			\centering
			\resizebox*{.9\textwidth}{!}{\includegraphics{example}}
			\caption[An example figure.]{An example figure that visually tries to integrate Lagrangian and Eulerian concepts.}
			\label{fig:example}
		\end{minipage}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

		
\subsection{A subsection}
\label{subsec:somesome}
		
As the \autoref{tab:typesomething} shows, this text has to introduce the thing before the table lists the use of the thing.
		
		
\begin{table}[hb] % try [h]ere, then [b]ottom to make sure the table is mentioned in the text before it is shown
	\centering
	\caption{Captions of tables should be positioned above the table, while figure captions should be in the bottom}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		\hline
		\textbf{Thing} & \textbf{Use} \\
		\hline
		something & something \\
		something & something \\
		something & something \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	% the label goes below the tabular env
	\label{tab:typesomething}
\end{table}
		
\subsection{No subsection goes alone}
\label{subsec:somenoth}

And it should also have some text.


\section{Something statistics}
\label{sec:somestatistics}
	
As shown in \autoref{eq:happiness}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:happiness}
	\mbox{happiness}=\frac{\mbox{EmptyCup}+\mbox{FavoriteDrink}}{\mbox{EmptyCups}}
\end{equation}
