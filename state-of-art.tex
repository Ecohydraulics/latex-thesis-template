\section{Types of something and image manipulation}
\label{sec:typesome}

Do \citeA{kundu2008fluid} talk about Lagrangian and Eulerian concepts visualized in \autoref{fig:example}?

Note that saving graphics in JPG format is usually the best option, and PNG is only useful for charts with low pixel coverage.

JPG is uitable for photographs and complex images where a smaller file size is important. It uses lossy compression, which reduces file size substantially. When using the JPG format for a thesis report, be sure to save at 300 dpi (dots per inch).

PNG is best used when you need lossless compression (heavy files!) and transparency support. It is ideal for charts with sharp edges, text, or areas of \textbf{solid} color, as it preserves detail without introducing compression artifacts.

GNU Image Manipulation Program, GIMP, is a powerful open-source image editing software suitable for a wide range of tasks, including photo retouching, image composition, and graphic design. It supports various file formats, including PNG and JPG, and provides advanced tools such as layer management, customizable brushes, and color correction features. GIMP is an excellent free alternative to commercial software, making it a great choice for students who ambition high-quality image editing capabilities without licensing costs.

\subsection{A subsection with table}
\label{subsec:somesome}
		
As the \autoref{tab:typesomething} shows, this text has to introduce the thing before the table lists the use of the thing.
		
		
\begin{table}[hb] % try [h]ere, then [b]ottom to make sure the table is mentioned in the text before it is shown
	\centering
	\caption{Captions of tables should be positioned above the table, while figure captions should be in the bottom}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		\hline
		\textbf{Thing} & \textbf{Use} \\
		\hline
		something & something \\
		something & something \\
		something & something \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	% the label goes below the tabular env
	\label{tab:typesomething}
\end{table}
		
\subsection{No subsection goes alone}
\label{subsec:somenoth}

And it should also have some text.


\section{Something statistics with an equation}
\label{sec:somestatistics}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:happiness}
