Present your results here. This section should not include and reference (citation) because you are presenting your results. If you need a reference, the sentence you are about to write probably better fits into the state-of-the-art, methods, or discussion.

Remember: your goal is to provide evidence for testing the hypotheses defined in \autoref{sec:rq}.
