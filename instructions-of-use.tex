	There are two options for using this template:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Use it in your browser with \href{https://www.overleaf.com/}{Overleaf}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item[] \textit{WARNING: Overleaf will require an internet connection - not good for working, e.g., in the train!}
				\item Download this project as a .zip folder.
				\item Load the ZIP folder in Overleaf
				\item Adapt, change it, write, and compile it in any TEX file of your project (Crtl + S)
			\end{itemize}
		\item Use it locally on your computer by installing a TeX/LaTeX typesetting system (e.g., MikTex or TexLive), and a LaTeX editor, such as \textit{TexStudio}, depending on your OS:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item On Windows: Get \href{https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex}{MikTex} - install for local user - DO NOT USE ADMIN ACCOUNT!
				\\ $\rightarrow$~Enable automatic package installation in MikTex Console: Check the "On-the-fly" installation of packages
				\item On Linux: Use \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX_Live}{TexLive}\\ $\rightarrow$~Install all packages with \texttt{sudo apt install texlive-full}
				\item On macOS: Either use \href{https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex}{MikTex} or \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX_Live}{TexLive} (both work potentially, however, we could not test the installation on macOS)
				\item Cross-platform editor: Download and install \href{https://www.texstudio.org/}{TexStudio} (or similar software)
				\item Compile main.tex with PDFLaTex (do not use LaTex or LuaLaTex compilers) in the following order: \texttt{pdflatex myThesis.tex} $>$ \texttt{bibtex myThesis.aux} $>$ \texttt{pdflatex myThesis.tex} $>$ \texttt{pdflatex myThesis.tex}. This ensures that the bibfile is correctly converted to a \texttt{.bbl} file, and used in the pdf output. Note that TexStudio does this procedure automatically.
			\end{itemize} 
	\end{enumerate}

	 Use proofreading in whichever Tex editor. Define if you'll use English (UK) or English (USA).
